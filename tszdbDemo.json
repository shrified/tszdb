      "story": "<p><b>Unit 1</b></p> <p><b>Critical Thinking</b></p> <p><b>&lsquo;Know Thyself&rsquo;</b></p> <p>Video Topics:</p> <p> Summary of this chapter (main Points) &nbsp;Exercise Solution (All Questions Answers) </p> <p>This is not easily understandable, first we need to study a novel named &ldquo; Wonder&rdquo; by RJ Palacio to Understand this.</p> <p>So here, A kid named &ldquo; August also called Auggie&rdquo; Has a special facial syndrome by which he has distorted facial shape.&nbsp;</p> <p>He is confidence-less since some students tease him at school. But, Since he is a very smart guy, a Humorous kid named &ldquo;Jack &ldquo; becomes friends with him. August starts feeling a little comfortable at school since he gets a new friend. Kindness is the main theme of this entire novel.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Summary</p> <p> When the bell rings, August checks his class schedule and sees that he is supposed to go to English in Room 321. He walks there with his head down, not stopping to find out if anyone he knows is going there, too. He arrives in a classroom where a bearded man is writing on the chalkboard. Once there, August again chooses a seat in the back of the room. August avoids making eye contact with anyone, and nobody except Jack sits near him. This interests August because Jack is obviously funny and well liked. If he wanted, he could probably sit with almost anyone. When the bell rings again, the teacher introduces himself as Mr. Browne and tells everyone the plan for the semester. Again, August notices the exact moment when the teacher spots him among the class. In the second period&mdash;which is English&mdash;Mr. Browne introduces the semester&apos;s syllabus. He notices Auggie, but keeps &quot;right on talking&quot; (1.Choose Kind.3). Mr. Browne introduces the class to &quot;Precepts = Rules about Really Important Things!&quot; (1.Chose Kind.3), and then the class brainstorms important things for a while as Mr. Browne writes their answers up on the board. Mr. Browne arrives at &quot;WHO WE ARE!&quot; as the most important of all the Important Things, and the most important question is, &quot;What kind of person am I?&quot; The September precept is: &quot;WHEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN BEING RIGHT OR BEING KIND, CHOOSE KIND.&quot; The class will discuss and write about the precept set by Mr. Browne each month. Mr. Browne even wants his students to come up with their own personal precept over the summer, and mail it to him from wherever they are. Needless to say, students and teachers alike are amazed that people actually do this. Auggie realizes he is going to like school no matter what. </p> <p><br></p> <p>Exercise</p> <p><br><br></p> <h2><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Unit 1</b></h2> <h2><b>Critical Thinking</b></h2> <h2><b>Know Thyself</b></h2> <p>Exercise&nbsp;</p> <p>Working with words&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Find the words from the text that match with the following meanings.&nbsp;</b> &nbsp;Shuffling : walking by dragging one&apos;s feet along or without lifting them fully from the ground&nbsp; &nbsp;Doodling&nbsp;:&nbsp;drawing pictures or patterns while thinking about something else&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaque: a piece of flat metal with writing on it&nbsp; &nbsp;Percept&nbsp;: a general rule intended to regulate behaviour or thought&nbsp; &nbsp;Sneak&nbsp;:&nbsp;move or go in a furtive or stealthy way&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Consult your teacher and define the following thinking skills.&nbsp;</b> <b>&nbsp;convergent thinking</b> </p> <p>= In convergence thinking, the answer to an issue may be derived by using established principles and logical reasoning. Solving a problem within the context of existing knowledge and refining the answer based on logical inference is what this kind of reasoning entails. Variety of tests, such as multiple choice tests, standardized tests, quizzes, spelling tests and similar other tests require convergent thinking, because only one answer can be 100% correct. A convergent thinker would only regard a person to be either sick or healthy.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;divergent thinking&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Divergent thinking is a way of thinking that involves examining many options. It is a creative way of finding the solution of a problem,</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;critical thinking</b> </p> <p>= Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process by which knowledge collected from or produced via observation, experience, contemplation, reasoning, or communication is actively and skilfully conceptualized, applied, analyzed, summarized or evaluated, as a guide to faith and action.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;creative thinking&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Creative thinking is a talent that allows you to look at things in a new way and from various perspectives. It is an innovative style of thinking that leads to unexpected findings and fresh ways of doing things. Creative thinking may be helped to create ideas through brainstorming or lateral thinking.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Comprehension&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</b></p> <p> &nbsp;Who was Jack? How did he make children laugh?&nbsp; </p> <p>= Jack was a friednly and kind-hearted kid who used to make children laugh childrens by cracking jokes and riddles.</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Why are &ldquo;Sharks&rdquo; important to Reid?&nbsp; </p> <p>= Sharks are important to Reid because they help to keep the ocean clean by eating dead organisms.</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What does Mr. Browne think about the most important thing?&nbsp; </p> <p>= Mr. Browne thinks that the most important thing is to know ownself, or own character&apos;s and evaluate them to bring out the best version of someone.</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What is that has not been noticed by the student?&nbsp; </p> <p>= &quot; The message in the notice board of the school entrance gate&quot; that writes - &quot;Know Thyself&quot; was the thing that has not been noticed by any student.</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;How did Jack make fun of the English class?&nbsp; </p> <p>= Jack made fun of the English class by sarcastically answering the teacher&apos;s question of &quot;Why are you here?&quot;. He answered in a funny way that they were there to attend English class while the answer was sensitive.</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What were the students going to do at the end of the month?&nbsp; </p> <p>= Students were going to submit the essay on the basis of the precepts that the teacher wrote as &quot; Mr. Browne&apos;s Precepts.&quot;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What particular act of students surprised a girl student?&nbsp; </p> <p>= Students used to come up with their very own personal precept, write it on a postcard, and mail it to Mr. Brownie (English Teacher) after their graduation, this thing surprised the girl student.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Critical thinking&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Have you made your own precept after you read this lesson? What is it? Share it with your friends.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Precept is a rule or principle that we make to conduct our behaviour in accordance with that. I also had many precepts even before reading this lesson. The major precepts of my life are:&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Anything that happens, happens for good&quot;,&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Always stay Positive&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot; Believe in Karma rather than fate&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot; What we are today is the result the choices we made yesterday, so we have to make choices wisely&quot;</p> <p><br></p> <p>These are some of the precepts which I don&apos;t only think are ideal but also try to ideally follow them in my daily behaviours.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;According to Josh Lanyon, &ldquo;If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity.&rdquo; Justify this statement with your logic.</b> </p> <p>= Critical Thinking is the biggest blessing that everyone wants. If someone has the skill to think creatively, she/he is sure to get name/fame/ and money. Creativeness brings the most out of someone. It brings newness, uniqueness and better ideas. From Handling any situation skilfully, communicating with people in a logical manner, to writing books, stories that everyone likes and is interested in, Creativity is the one that matters.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Josh Lanyon has said this very finest quote which I personally liked very much. Creativity enables us to more freely and innovatively examine and resolve issues. Creativity expands up your thinking. A civilization that has lost touch with its creative side is a society in which generations may be closed. It expands our prospects and may assist us to overcome obstacles.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In Nutshell, Creativity encourages group thinking.</p> <p>Creativity fosters ideas.</p> <p>Creativity promotes resilience.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Grammar</b></p> <p><b>Question Tag</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Rewrite the following sentences adding appropriate question tag.</b> &nbsp;Gill does not know Ann,&nbsp;<b><i>Does he</i></b>? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m very patient,&nbsp;<b><i>Aren&apos;t I</i></b>? &nbsp;They&rsquo;d never met me before,&nbsp;<b><i>had they?</i></b> &nbsp;Listen carefully,&nbsp;<b><i>will you?</i></b> &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s have a break,&nbsp;<b><i>shall we?</i></b> &nbsp;Let us invite them,&nbsp;<b><i>Shall we?</i></b> &nbsp;Hari used to live in France as a boy,&nbsp;<b><i>didn&apos;t he?</i></b> &nbsp;You&rsquo;d better not take a hard drink,&nbsp;<b><i>had you?</i></b> &nbsp;Sheep eat grass,&nbsp;<b><i>don&apos;t they?</i></b> &nbsp;Mr. Pande can speak nine languages,<b><i>&nbsp;can&apos;t he</i></b>? &nbsp;She&rsquo;s finished her classes,&nbsp;<b><i>hasn&apos;t she?</i></b> &nbsp;She barely managed to reach the goal, did she? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let him swim in that pond, Will you? &nbsp;There are lots of people here, aren&apos;t there? </p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Read the following situations.

If necessary, a strong family will provide protection against pressures from the outside world and provide its members the confidence they need to confront these challenges.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What were the features of a medieval European family?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= The main feature of the Medieval European family is that it was&nbsp;male-dominated and extended.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What caused the dissolution of extended families in the West?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= When it comes to changing family structures in Western countries, industrialisation is the main reason, along with urbanization has brought about and continues to bring about numerous new developments. Unmarried youths in particular abandoned rural areas to work in factories in metropolitan areas. As a result of this procedure, a number of extended families were dissolved.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What change occurred in gender roles in the modern family that emerged after the Industrial Revolution?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Originarily, the industrial revolution led to a domestication of women, as men went to occupations in other sectors and women were expected to care for the children. Similarly, Family responsibilities that were previously believed to be entirely male or female were changed into shared responsibilities. Also, As divorce rates rose, so did the number of one-parent families.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is family law?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Legal problems related to family relationships, such as adoption and divorce, are dealt with under the field of law, which is called family law. Children&apos;s issues are handled by family law attorneys as well as other relevant legal issues.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How is modern marriage defined?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>=Simply modern marriages are defined as such marriages where the husband and wife share responsibilities. Traditional weddings have trapped the couples into their predetermined roles without a choice. Modern marriages make individual choices possible. The couples are regarded as equal partners and women have a role in decision-making for the family.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do special family courts try to do?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Family court is a special court for legal issues originating from family connections. The family court is typically a combination of various kinds of courts, such as the courts and orphan courts, which deal with specific family issues such as&nbsp;matrimonial issues, spousal property, the legitimacy of any person, maintenance, guardianship of the person or custody of or access to any minor.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the legislation on child labour and child abuse declare?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= The legislation on child labour and child abuse declares that &quot;No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or employed in any hazardous employment.&quot; It further asserts on child interest-based behaviours to be done and of free education and health care.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is common among most legal systems regarding property?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= In most legal systems a departed family member can deal with property sharing. The will or legacy describes the decedents&apos; desires for such distribution, however, what appears to be irrational or unfair provisions could be opposed by the spouse or child survivors. In case property is not claimed, there are also laws which recognize family claims (i.e., with no will to determine its distribution).</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Critical thinking&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What changes have started to occur in Nepali families in recent days? What impacts will they bring on society? Discuss.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= In today&apos;s families in Nepal, though patriarchy has it&apos;s deep rooted presence, some changes have started to roll out. Women are being independent. They are not only trapped in hope doing home activities that were predetermined. Gender equality and equal rights are evolving in Nepal at a gradual pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every member of the family understands each other happily and may share an idea, the concept in the family. Both men and women can control the household, their own country, in Nepali households.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the past, marriages were organized by parents and all social traditions were followed. However, today&apos;s trend is totally different and young people in Nepali society decide their future independently and marriage, particularly in universities and colleges, and friend groups are active. The reason for raising the ratio of divorce is because parents do not participate and adolescents have made mistaken decisions about the wrong results.</p> <p>In today&apos;s development oriented families, Everyone in the family, male and female, has equal rights. The tradition of living in a joint family barely prevails in Nepali society. Nowadays, young couples desire to live with children, husbands and women in a nuclear family with full happiness, yet on the other hand divorce is rapidly increasing in Nepal as a result of the nuclear family&apos;s misunderstanding. The feeling of selfishness has emerged and people expect their sensation to gratify nowadays.&nbsp;</p> <p>The major advantage that a nuclear family has is a separate entity that is completely free of older members&apos; supervision. The children in the nuclear family are closer to their parents and they may readily talk to themselves about their concerns. People in a nuclear family can freely make their decisions and set new regulations and rules for their little households. Nuclear families are financially stable enough to live with their children in luxury. Women have a lot of time in the nuclear family to take care of their children, but they also can control things as they like.</p> <p>But on the other hand, You can&apos;t receive support instantly in your emergency in a nuclear household. Children cannot grow up with their grandparents as well as other family members and they do not comprehend the culture and values of the family for this reason. A nuclear family is not helping, so women must play several duties, such as cooking, babysitting, and so on, so it&apos;s hard for them to take care of themselves or manage their relationship with others. The husband and wife of a nuclear family generally work, and their children are neglected and emotionally unsafe. They will start to feel lonely when they go free. Housewives, in particular, may feel alone if no one speaks.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;We see many elderly people in the elderly homes these days in Nepal. Some of them are abandoned while others live there willingly. Do you think Nepali people are deviating from their traditional culture? Give reasons.</b> </p> <p>= Majority of people in today&apos;s society have lost their souls, promised to earn money for themselves. Our desire for owning and enjoying material things creates this scenario. We weren&apos;t as old, the elders were respected, adored in a common family structure, were the apple of the eye. Now it&apos;s all nuclear, family, arms, theory of the single child. Happiness is the main motivation, as if we&apos;re going to live forever. Everything else is thrown away. This is the cause of the sad condition of seniors&apos; families&apos; ideals and the culprits are western culture and materialistic views.</p> <p>In nepali society, greed, study reasons and industrialization is also the cause of the sorry state of our elderly people. People are busy at their work and jobs, and have no time to take care of their old parents. That is why Even parents do not want to stay with their offspring with the fear of being neglected. Nepali people are not actually deviating from their traditional culture, but the time and busy work schedules and desire of having a very small or nuclear family is the main cause of such a state of older people in our society.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Writing</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay on The Importance of Family.</b> </p> <p><b>Importance of Family</b></p> <p>Family is defined as a group of one or more parents and their children living together as a unit. &nbsp;Family is a valuable gift that god has given to us. Love, support, and a shared set of values are all provided by the family. Each member of the family teaches and serves the others, and they participate in each other&apos;s pleasures and sorrows in life together.&nbsp;People grow in their families.</p> <p>A child&apos;s family is the single most significant impact on his or her development. Since their infancy, children have relied on their parents and relatives to protect them and care for their basic necessities, as well as to educate them. Families and parents are the first people a kid meets. In addition to providing protection and identity, families instill values in all members, regardless of age. The family comes to the rescue when a member of the family is insecure or in danger and needs assistance. He develops a sense of self and a basis for the rest of his life as a result. This includes the familial values, which form the basis for his personal moral code. Time spent with family teaches people the importance of love, gratitude, and open communication.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Maintaining family customs also reinforces the significance of the bond between members of the family. We call them &quot;family traditions&quot; because they&apos;re events that families share on a regular basis. In addition to creating a lifetime of memories, these events offer family members a greater feeling of belonging. Every member of the family feels significant because of the connection that is formed.</p> <p>In nutshell, God&apos;s greatest gift to us is our family. In other words, it&apos;s the first lesson in how to relate to people. &apos;Family&apos; has a great deal of meaning. In other words, it is feeling safe, having someone you can rely on, and having someone with whom you can talk about your difficulties with. But it also entails mutual respect and a shared sense of responsibility for others.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Some individuals believe that living in a nuclear family is preferable. Others believe that living with extended relatives is preferable. What are your thoughts? Write an essay comparing and contrasting the benefits and drawbacks of each.</b> </p> <p>The ideal family is one that allows each family member to develop and have his or her own space, appreciates ideas and views, believes in equality, and shares mutual respect and understanding. Of course, every family has its unique set of problems. However, the family that overcomes all of this and does not drag the problems are the ideal.</p> <p>If members of a joint family or a nuclear family aren&apos;t permitted to express themselves properly, they may feel very lonely and a feeling of lack of freedom.</p> <p>A nuclear family has its own set of disadvantages. At times, you may feel lost. Especially while parenting small children without the assistance of parents or other family members. A combined family may be more beneficial in this regard. But, before I form a judgment, I should note that, since a joint family has many people, there may be many diverse views and conflicts.</p> <p>There are many Joint family&apos;s advantages. Children have a great time. Whenever you need it, you may ask for help. Childs learn moral values from older people. There are enough people in your life to take care of. It reduces workload.</p> <p>On the other hand, Young couples have less alone time. Everything is a family affair, therefore it&apos;s unusual to see a couple out and about on their own. Their schedules for domestic chores may vary.</p> <p>Overwhelming amounts of unwelcome advice leave little room for experimentation. The rules are enforced with more rigor. Last but not least, there is the issue of money. As long as the family&apos;s income is derived from a shared source, it is OK. It is tough to manage finances if everyone earns differently. Either the high-income individual has to pay more, or the quality of life for him/her would be much lower if everyone paid equally.</p> <p>So, to summarize my opinion, it depends on who makes up the family. Members must be patient with one another.

Here, Pain means the painful feeling caused because of losing many matches. That&apos;s why the reporter says that England is waiting to heal its half-century long pain.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did the Italian players react as soon as they became the champions?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Jubilant Italy players started shouting at the TV saying &quot;It&apos;s coming Rome&quot; `It&apos;s coming Rome&quot;. which was the capital of Italy. It was actually a mock of the anthem of the England Football Team which meant football coming home.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did Saka and Sancho cry?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> Saka and Sancho cried because their team lost on penalties. Both players missed their spot kicks during the shootout as Gianluigi Donnarumma&apos;s save from Saka&apos;s shot helped in the victory for Italy.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Penalty shoot-out has long been a bitter experience for the English team. Why?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>England has lost the matches frequently due to the miss in penalty shootout, that&rsquo;s why penalty shoot-out has long been a bitter experience for the English team. In Euro 2020, Bukayo Saka, England&apos;s youngest players, missed the penalty that handed Italy the championship and denied England its first international victory since 1966 in Euro Cup 2020. England team penalty kickers Marcus Rashford and Jared Sancho also have failed to convert their shootout to the victory in the past. Such a condition had happened for the third consecutive time.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;State the contribution of Roberto Mancini to Italian football.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Roberto Mancini led the Italian national football team to unparalleled success. He was the driving force behind the Italian team&apos;s rise from the depths of despair to the pinnacle of the sport. He has turned Italy into a professional football team that still adheres to the country&apos;s traditional defense principles by using Italian players from the start, encouraging confidence in the national squad, and enduring a cultural reset.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only four years ago, Italy&apos;s football history was shattered as it failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years. Now, they&apos;re the greatest team in Europe, and Roberto Mancini has led them to a 34-game winning streak, a national record. To win Euro Cup 2020, Mancini instills tremendous confidence in the Italian football squad. At these Euros, 25 of the 26-man team have played on the field at any point.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the Euro Cup final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals? How?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>When Italian players face English players in the Euro Cup final 2020, they use the same strategy that English players used when they faced Croatians in the 2018 World Cup Semifinals. In the 2018 World Cup semifinals, England scored early against Croatia and then spent the rest of the game chasing its opponent&apos;s midfield until succumbing in extra time due to a recent Croatian goal. So, the Euro 2020 Match also reminds the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Critical thinking&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;&quot;Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind you and start over again.&quot; Does this apply to the Italian football team when we analyse their performance from their failure to qualify for the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b> Italy is constantly improving and investing more in the enhancement of its football team. Though they had faced many challenges, digested many defeats, we can say that they are constantly improving themselves and now the football culture in Italy is second to none.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The Italian football team pushed on with specific goals in mind, erasing any lingering differences. Within the past four years, this team seemed optimistic. The team&apos;s players and coach kept up their efforts to win the championship trophy. They understand the importance of player development.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Many losses have befallen the Italian football squad in the last few years. The coach Roberto Mancini was the driving force behind this team&apos;s triumph. &nbsp;He provided excellent leadership throughout the course of those four years. They were all masters in management, strategic planning, and physical treatment. They were successful in the upper divisions of the national football leagues because of their dedication and sense of camaraderie. Most of their national matches went their way, and they even qualified for the World Cup. The members of this squad were all top-notch professionals.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The strategy of this team was continuously evolving. It was a long and difficult journey for the whole team to reach their goal of becoming champions. They continued on their path full of energy and passion, free of any sense of regret. For them, every game was a chance to try something new. After each battle, they honed their skills and tactics.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;When a team plays in a home ground, it gets a huge support from the audience in the stadium. Does this support them to win the match or the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose? What do you think?</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Yes, the players benefit much from this. Players like the opportunity to compete in front of their own fans, who provide constant encouragement and motivation throughout the game. On the field, the audience&apos;s encouragement of the team members means a great deal to them. The games take place in a more intimate setting, with a more supporting crowd. However, the players may also encounter unexpected outcomes in the course of the games.</p> <p><br></p> <p>There is no way to predict the outcome of a game. Players may even feel pressured to play their home games in front of their adoring fans. Because they don&apos;t want to disappoint their fans, players avoid losing in front of them. They are anxious about the outcome of the match. In their home stadium, they have a lot of pressure to win against their rivals. When they first begin to play, they make a lot of blunders because they are scared. As a result, they lose games and are criticized by both their supporters and the media.</p> <p><b>Writing</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Correct the punctuation marks of the following text.</b> </p> <h5>A lot of people try to get away from home for a few days each year for a holiday. There are lots of things to choose from, and where you go depends on how much money you&apos;ve got to spend. Ideas for holidays include relaxing on a beach, exploring cities, and skiing. One man wanted to go to Australia but thought he&apos;d never have enough money to get there. He&apos;d go to his brother&rsquo;s caravan at the seaside instead. A young woman wanted to go clubbing in Ibiza as she&apos;d heard it was a lot of fun.</h5> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write a news story based on the given information.</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Argentina beats Brazil in the COPA America Cup.</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>By Reuters</p> <p><br></p> <p>July 10th, Rio de Janeiro: Argentina&apos;s first major championship in 28 years is secured on Saturday because of Angel Di Maria&apos;s goal which gave them a 1-0 victory against Brazil. The 15th Copa America title is now in Argentina&apos;s hands.</p> <p>Lionel Messi&apos;s first medal in an Argentina shirt after more than a decade of club and individual awards was a remarkable incident in the match. On his maiden appearance in the Copa, Di Maria opened the scoring when he came on as a substitute in the second half.</p> <p><br>After the goal, Brazil&apos;s players were put under even more strain. After the first half, the second half of the game seemed to be rather exciting. However, despite Brazil fielding a five-man forward line in the second half and playing aggressively against Argentina&apos;s De Paul-covered defense, they were unable to score a goal.<br><br>From the beginning to the end, it seemed as though Brazil had no other alternatives. Argentina used skills to defeat Brazil.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;We can see many countries competing to host the great international sport events like the World Cup Football. But, there are arguments that hosting an event like World Cup Football can have more problems than benefits. What do you think? Write your arguments in favour or against hosting an international sport event in about 500 words.</b> </p> <p><b>=</b>&nbsp; Every coin has two sides. &nbsp;We can argue in both verses. Organizing Games has many advantages.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sports events have a significant impact on infrastructure development in the host cities. This includes improvements to transportation systems and accommodation facilities; swimming pools; communication systems; new sports stadiums; and more.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Because of ticket sales and other income sources like broadcast rights, the host country obtains millions of dollars. Tourists are encouraged to visit the host country, which generates more foreign currency. Consequently, the worldwide prestige of the host country improves and rises as a consequence of this.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In addition to boosting tourism, these events provide locals with employment opportunities. Encouragement from home supporters helps the players to do well in football matches as well.</p> <p><br></p> <p>With this in mind, there are several negatives to hosting a large event. The customary routines of the locals are thrown off. People may be forced to abandon their houses if the government seizes their land for the event. If the locals are against the event, the host country may have to pay a lot of money to host it. It might even affect the culture and also bring environmental pollution.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Grammar</b></p> <p><b>Countable = few</b></p> <p><b>Unountable = little</b></p> <p><b>Countable = few bhanda thorai badhi testo bela&nbsp;</b><b><i>a few</i></b><b>&nbsp;use garnus</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Complete the following sentences with much, many, few or little.&nbsp;</b> &nbsp;He is an introvert.

How does it work?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Hyperloop is a planned train that would be capable of travelling at incredible speeds. It&apos;s superfast because it&apos;s enclosed in a tube with no air in it. As a result of the lack of air, there will be no friction to slow the train down.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How is hyperloop more beneficial than the traditional trains?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Hyperloop is much more beneficial and superior than any traditional or a high-speed rail. It&apos;s less expensive and uses less energy since the track doesn&apos;t have to provide electricity to the pods constantly and because the pods may depart every 30 seconds, it&apos;s more like a demand-based service.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Does hyperloop have a successful history? How?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>No, it does not have a successful history since the original concept for hyperloop was to use waggons and pneumatic tubes to transport mail and parcels between buildings which was ultimately a failure.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write the contributions of Robert Goddard and Elon Musk for the development of hyperloop.</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> As early as the early 20th century, Robert Goddard developed the &quot;vactrain&quot; concept. This is certainly an origin to the hyperloop. Since then, there have been a significant number of similar ideas.</p> <p>Elon Musk, the creator of SpaceX and Tesla, came up with the notion of the hyperloop in order to offer ultra-fast intercity transportation. Travel pods enclosed within steel tubes will serve as Elon Musk&apos;s &quot;fifth mode of transportation,&quot; which will be superior to any cars, planes, boats, and trains. His &apos;Hyperloop Alpha&apos; publication in August 2013 sparked the concept of hyperloop.<br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What relation does speed have with air resistance? Explain.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>More Air resistance decreases the speed of a moving body and vice versa. Since, Hyperloop will travel through the vacuum tubes, the speed will drastically increase as the result of no-air resistance.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are hyperloop capsules compared with? How are they similar?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Hyperloop capsules are compared to Boeing 747s because they both accelerate at the same rate of speed.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How do the passengers feel while travelling via hyperloop? What will be done to make it luxurious?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>On a hyperloop, the passengers feel approximately the same as riding a lift or a passenger aircraft.

What does success depend on?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> Hyperloop&apos;s success will be determined on the destinations, the local economy, and the geographical location. The author has concerns regarding hyperloop&apos;s viability because of the enormous multibillion-dollar expenditure and the fact that the projects are still in the pilot and experimental phases. In the past, Nikola Tesla and Elon Musk had already closed the same concept program, due to no response from government authorities.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Critical thinking</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Is the hyperloop the future of transportation or just a dream? What do you think? Justify your opinion with suitable reasons.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>=The hyperloop, in my opinion, is the way transportation will be in the future. When Elon Musk&apos;s concept of Hyperloop first appeared in 2013, it was hailed as a &quot;futuristic mass transportation system.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The fact that the box floats in the tubes and only makes its way a few millimeters above the ground is the most impressive aspect about the Hyperloop. It is expected not only to shorten travel times between cities, but also expected to be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than current modes of transportation. Using pneumatic steel tubes, it will travel from one end to the other at supersonic speeds.</p> <p><br></p> <p>But, Hyperloop has many challenges. First, the development of Hyperloop will be very expensive, hence won&rsquo;t be economical to all types of travelers. It&apos;s still in the testing phase, even though the corporations involved are keen to tout the technology&apos;s potential. Despite the attractiveness of this new technology, it takes time to realize its full potential.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>If inventors and innovators succeed in their initiatives, it might be the transportation method of the future. Nothing has been impossible to us, to create or manage in past and present as well. So, I think that hyperloops have the potential to revolutionize transportation.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The number of private vehicles is increasing day by day in Nepal beyond the capacity of our infrastructure. What do you think should be done to curb the ever-growing number of private vehicles? Discuss.</b> </p> <p>Nepal&apos;s infrastructure is being outpaced by private automobile and vehicle use. Vehicle ownership is constantly rising among the Nepalese population. Despite the fact that they save time and privacy, they are hazardous to the environment since they cause greater pollution, traffic congestion, and road deaths.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>As a solution to this problem, even though petroleum costs are rising, more and more people are buying their own vehicles. As a result, traffic is expanding at an alarming rate.</p> <p><br></p> <p>It is time to outlaw private vehicles since their extensive use harms the environment and raises harmful gas emissions that will cause big difficulties in the future. We should reduce the number of vehicles on the road by putting public transit first and prioritizing it above private autos.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>There should be limits on the use of old personal automobiles by municipal administrations. New highways need to be constructed or existing ones widened. People must use public transportation. The public and the government should be worried about this. Some of the traffic congestion may be alleviated by widening the roads. As a last point, public transportation should be emphasized, including the bus, rail, and so on.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Working together, the government and citizens can make this happen. Effective management is needed to avoid a growth in the number of automobiles and their detrimental impacts because it&apos;s almost insane to stop people from purchasing and using personal vehicles.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Grammar</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Rewrite the following sentences with the correct form of the verbs in the brackets.</b> &nbsp;The invitation is for one person.

After his arrival, one of his first tasks was to find an apartment close to work, as he did not have a car. Usually, there are many different places to choose from, and he considers cost, location, and luxury. If one apartment has a washing machine and dryer and costs four hundred dollars a month, he prefers to rent it over another apartment which has significantly less rent and is located two blocks from a Laundromat. Rob&apos;s family never wanted to live in an apartment on the thirteenth floor, since all of them fear heights. He also tried to choose an apartment with a landlord recommended by former tenants. Everybody knows that it is important to find a responsible landlord. Rob and his wife love to cook together when both are free, so they need a spacious, well-equipped kitchen. Rob often looks for a place with an air conditioner because there are so many scorching days and nights in Arizona. Whenever Rob finds a new apartment, all of his concerns disappear. He felt relieved and called his mother. Someone understands!</p> <p>"

Do you find any association of his childhood days in shaping his career? Explain with specific instances from the text.</b> </p> <p>APJ Abdul Kalam is now a renowned aerospace scientist. There is a proverb in Nepali,&nbsp;<b><i>&quot;&nbsp;</i></b><i>plants that prosper have smooth leaves &quot;</i>. This proverb is applicable in Kalam&apos;s life as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>His professional life has undoubtedly been shaped by memories and experiences from his upbringing. He was particularly impressed by his instructor Sivasubramania lyer&apos;s practical lesson. Sivasubramania Iyer was a teacher who used to teach them how the birds fly. He brought them to the beach to demonstrate how birds fly in a real-world setting. Solving difficult mathematical puzzles was his main source of entertainment. In addition to this, he would attend after-school math lessons at the residence of his math instructor. Following his teacher&apos;s advice and learning about the bird&apos;s flying systems, he went on to become an aeronautical scientist.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>All these things have actually helped Kalam develop a practical knowledge about the aero-science. In fact, Abdul Kalam became a well-known aeronautical scientist as a result of his high school instructor Sivasubramania Lyer&apos;s explanation of avian flight dynamics.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Kalam mentions an instance of discrimination against him in his school life. What picture of society does he want to depict by mentioning the incident? Discuss.</b> </p> <p>There was a teacher in Kalam&apos;s school who used to impose religion in class. His stomach couldn&apos;t take the idea of a Hindu kid and a Muslim child becoming friends, so he banned Abdul from sitting with him. Abdul didn&apos;t know that Hindus and Muslims face different levels of treatment because of their religions. This behaviour infuriated Abdul.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The teacher was warned by Kalam&apos;s father and the temple&apos;s chief priest not to bring religion into the classroom, so there must have been some glimmer of hope for religious tolerance. However, the teacher was influenced by profound religious doctrine, although representing educated and intelligent individuals. He had to obey the social norms since he was a part of the society. The event serves as a reminder of the religious divisions that existed in India at the time.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Hindus and Muslims were treated quite differently back then because of this severe religious segregation. Abdul hopes that this event would paint an image of a society divided between Hindus and Muslims. He wants to flash the fact that the majority of people, even those with higher educational levels of education, believed in such partitions, and only a small minority disagreed. I would say - Abdul Kamal describes a painful incident of religious intolerance in his school memoirs.&nbsp;</p> <p>.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Writing</b></p> <p><b>Write a short autobiography featuring your childhood life using the following guidelines.</b></p> <p>I was born in a small village south - eastern of Baglung District. Our memories give us the will to live and the motivation to do things. I have a lot of cherished childhood memories.

Prior to going to my morning class, I had to get myself organised. As a result of being a little weaker in maths, I was forced to attend class at my math teacher&apos;s house. My day-to-day routine was very straightforward.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I was going to leave as soon as my classes were over and head straight for my house. My mother was kind and caring at the same time. The hot meal used to be ready, thanks to my mother. After we&apos;d eaten our fill, I&apos;d have time to get ready for school. Because I could listen to my teacher teach stories and poems in English class, it was one of my favourite subjects. The years I spent in school were the best of my life. Apart from studying, we used to spend our free time having fun with our peers, exchanging snacks, and poking fun at each other.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Grammar</b></p> <p><b>Connectives</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Study the following sentences and underline the connectives.</b> &nbsp;Although&nbsp;she spoke very fast, I understood what she meant to say. &nbsp;In spite of&nbsp;her hard labour, she failed her exam. &nbsp;Though&nbsp;he had all the required qualifications, he did not get the job. &nbsp;Despite&nbsp;having all the qualifications, he did not get the job. </p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Join the following pairs of sentences twice, using a/though/though/even though and despite/in spite of as in the example.</b> </p> <p>Example: Nepali people have limited income.

Taxes, revenue, fines, car fees, registration fees, and service fees that must be paid to the appropriate government agency may be paid in many forms. Similar payments may be made for electric and telecommunications services as well as drinking water and insurance premiums and social security benefits.

&nbsp;After her study in Namibia, Scott came to the realization that&nbsp;laughter is one of our richest vocal tics.&nbsp; &nbsp;Studies have shown that there are six universal expressions across cultures based on&nbsp;facial expressions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Scott found out that most of the laughs have nothing to&nbsp;do with humour. &nbsp;The couples who laugh at each other are likely to&nbsp;stay together for longer.&nbsp; &nbsp;The primary way of communication of grown up people is&nbsp;to express feelings and meet social expectations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Comedians usually find it easier to work in larger places&nbsp;due to the contagious nature of laughter. </p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</b> <b>&nbsp;Why do people giggle at someone&apos;s pain or suffering?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>People giggle at someone else&apos;s agony or suffering because their brains are activated by the sensation of such news, but they may later come to realize that they are actually sympathizing with them and doing their best to alleviate their suffering.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What did Scott&apos;s study in Namibia come up with?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Scott&rsquo;s study in Namibia has found that laughter is one of the most expressive voice qualities.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How is laughter a social bonding?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Laughter is a social bonding because a social connection is formed when people laugh together, which shows they enjoy and agree with one another as well as that they are part of the same social group.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;According to the author, what role does laughter play in a husband wife relationship?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>According to the author, their relationship is more likely to last a long time if they can laugh together after a stressful experience.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does laughter work as a painkiller?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Laughter works as a painkiller because endorphins are released as a result of laughter, which makes people feel better when they&apos;re in pain.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What did the study find about the relation between laughter and the brain?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The study finds that the brain operates as a mirror region and is alloyed by laughter, which has a close connection to each type of laughter.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are two emotions that the author associates with infants and adults?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Infants&apos; crying is the primary means of communication, whereas an adult&apos;s crying is more significant because it is associated with uncontrollable and unnatural emotions.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does a stand-up comedian take the audience&apos;s laughter?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>A stand-up comedian views the laughter of the audience as an opportunity for communication and interaction.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Show the relation between laughter and crowd.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The crowd and laughter are directly related to the activities or dialogue taking place, as the laughter of the crowd represents a wave of amusement in them and they are enthusiastic and supportive of what is going on.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the author mean when he says &quot;there is always a meaning to it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>When the author says, &quot;There is always a meaning to it,&quot;

Why?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Yes, I agree that the couples who laugh together, stay together.&apos; Also, It is important for married couples to have the same sense of humour. Couples who enjoy one other&apos;s company are more likely to remain together.&nbsp;</p> <p>Laughing together signifies supporting each other&apos;s opinions and maintaining a connection or link, which is important for married couples. They are more likely to remain together longer, and laughing together encourages them to share more personal information, allowing them to establish a stronger bond.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to this, Laughing helps them cope with stress. It strengthens their friendship and their partnership. It&apos;s a good idea to back each other up. Because of this, they are more likely to remain together for the long term. It provides them with a window into their own personal data.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Some people believe that sometimes crying is good for health. Do you believe it? Give your reasons.</b> </p> <p>Crying may be beneficial to one&apos;s health, according to some people. I also believe that statement because I have some scientific reasons to believe. As a natural technique to alleviate mental stress, it removes stress hormones and other pollutants from our bodies. People who cry feel less anxious or tense. When people weep, they return to their regular selves, free of the competing desires they had been holding in. A person&apos;s inner wounds may be released as a result of this practice.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>WRITING&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write a paragraph narrating an event from your life when you were involved in contagious laughter.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Laughter is called contagious when one person laughs, and the laughter spreads to others. We visited the Bhairav Sthan Temple with our college friends last year. It was early in the morning. In our luggage, we had a few packets of dry food. Hari was going really slowly and was at the end of the queue, so one of my pals - Ram made a joke about him being a tortoise. Everyone began laughing as a result of Ram&apos;s amusement, which in turn made everyone else laugh as well. All of us were stricken with laughter by that incident. At the conclusion, Hari began to chuckle as well. It was an occasion in my life that brought a grin to my face every time I remembered it, and it&apos;s one that I&apos;ll never forget.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write a description of your favourite comedian explaining his/her personality, acting, performance and uniqueness.</b> </p> <p>My favourite comedian is Kedar Ghimire. He is popular by his stage name &lsquo;Magne Budha&rsquo;. He is a well-known Nepali comedian, actor, director, and social worker. He is also an accomplished playwright, director, and actor. TV serials in Nepal include him as one of their key characters. Meri Bassai used to be one of the best and most successful Tele Serials because of humorous characters like him. When people see him in action, they can&apos;t stop laughing. Though he stopped working in Meri Bassai, he &nbsp;starred in the box office success Chha Ekan Chha. Wada Number Chha, his second film, was likewise a hit. The Nepalese people like his acting, charisma, and social activism. As a social worker, he is also quite active. In the wake of the earthquake, he has done much to help those in need.

There existed such a system where the trash was used to be cleaned up at a specific time at a specific place. He calls it awkward to learn their habit of not using anything second hand material, no matter if it is a car or an expensive TV set. He calls it sarcastic because people who were too shy and spirited at day time not using second hand items were also picking up things at night.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the two reasons behind the existence of Sodaigomi in Japanese culture?</b> </p> <p>Ans: The two factors&nbsp;behind the existence of Sodaigomi in Japanese culture&nbsp;were the absence of a basement, garage or extra room in the tiny Japanese home and the Japanese love for cleanliness.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What, according to the author, do the Japanese feel at the thought of buying second-hand items?</b> </p> <p>Ans: Japanese feel like buying&nbsp;second hand items as buying someone&rsquo;s socks. It means they feel very timid and uncivilized to use second hand items.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How is Malaysian culture different from Japanese culture concerning the used items?</b> </p> <p>Ans: While Japan is a place of wealth, no one in Malaysia throws anything away because they believe that everything should be utilised. In second-hand stores where products are auctioned off, Malaysians bid excitedly. &nbsp;But in Japan, even the expensive items are thrown off and second hand items are considered as used socks of someone.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did the author feel awkward at the sodaigomi pile?</b> </p> <p>Ans:&nbsp;&nbsp;The author felt awkward at the sodaigomi pile because he wanted to grab things which were needed to him but was timid to grab against the typical Japanese culture.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How many articles did the author bring to his house one after another?</b> </p> <p>Ans: Tea and an expensive chair were the first items the author brought. After that, he picked up a new bicycle bell, a little wooden cabinet, a full set of wrenches and screwdrivers in a metal toolbox, a Naugahyde-covered barstool, a lacquer serving tray, bookshelves, televisions, etc.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why do most people try to find things in the trash pile &lsquo;in the dead of the night&rsquo;?</b> </p> <p>Ans:&nbsp; Most people try to find things in the trash in the dead of the night because not everyone can afford to always use first and fresh items. Another reason was, that was the time when people had no shame or mocking at picking up things that were needed.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did the author&rsquo;s family assimilate Japanese culture in using consumer goods?</b> </p> <p>Ans: Assimilate means to digest or to be habitual with. The Author&rsquo;s family assimilated with Japanese Culture in using consumer goods by picking up things at night and being luxurious in day time, like the Japanese did. Consumed goods are not used by the majority of Japanese citizens. But, some used to pick up trash at night because they are not supervised.&nbsp;</p> <h1><br></h1> <h1><b>&nbsp;Critical thinking&nbsp;</b></h1> <p> <b>&nbsp;If you happen to be in Japan someday, will you collect articles from sodaigomi? Why or why not?</b> </p> <p>Ans: It depends upon the situation. If I happen to be in Japan someday, I will surely collect articles from sodaigomi if I have no or average financial strength.&nbsp;For various reasons (education, job, etc.), many citizens from Nepal move to Japan. Money management is a problem for them. To save money, I will probably utilize second-hand products, since they have a lot of essentials. In order to avoid detection, I may collect them without anybody noticing. Using an used item is not a sin in my culture. &nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;There are some second hand shops in Nepal, too. But, people are not much interested in them. What practice would be suitable in managing second hand items in Nepal?</b> </p> <p>Ans:&nbsp;The reasons for our reluctance to buy used things from such stores are many. The first reason is that we are ashamed to admit that we purchase second hand goods. As soon as other people find out that we&apos;re purchasing second-hand products, they&apos;re quick to criticize us. Sellers at second-hand businesses are unreliable who usually make fake promises in the long-term usefulness and durability of resale items.</p> <p>In order to manage second hand items, second-hand purchases should become a regular part of our shopping habits. We should not be embarrassed about utilizing these products. We should avoid buying used products that are in poor shape, but we may purchase second hand furniture, electrical equipment, and automobiles that are in decent condition.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Writing</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write a paragraph focusing on the concept of waste management using the 3rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle).</b> </p> <p>Answer: - Toxic waste emissions are a major cause of environmental degradation, and the 3Rs are the most efficient strategy to combat this problem. The 3rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) rubbish management strategy is the greatest way to decrease pollution. If we can&apos;t utilize them, we&apos;ll have to find a buyer for them at a recycling plant. &nbsp;Our ecosystem is being polluted by human garbage, which has a variety of harmful consequences on both people and animals. Minimizing the amount of garbage we generate each day is the goal of reducing. It is good for the environment, human health and the economy when less garbage is generated. A better environment and sustainable development may be achieved by adopting this kind of behavior. People are healthier when there is less pollution and a higher national health index. There must be an effort to reuse goods such as plastic bottles, bags, and metals instead of throwing them away.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;In most of Nepal&apos;s cities, waste management is a major issue. Write a letter to the editor to be published in the daily newspaper suggesting ways of &lsquo;Solving Garbage Problems.&rsquo;</b> </p> <p>Tinkune-5, Kathmandu</p> <p>16, November 2021</p> <p>To the editor,</p> <p>Himalayan Daily,</p> <p>Kathmandu, Nepal</p> <p><br></p> <p>Subject: To publish my article on garbage management in Nepal.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Dear Sir,</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not necessary to remind you that the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, has been plagued by waste for the last 20 years, but now the whole country is affected. Not only the city inhabitants but also the foreigners and tourists have an unfavorable impression of our city because it is littered with waste. I&apos;ll go through some of the best strategies to avoid the issue of garbage here. I&apos;d appreciate it if you published my article on Garbage management, which is a major issue in most of Nepal&apos;s major cities.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Garbage has many sources, in which household, industries, hospitals, vehicles are the major. First, we should separate the garbage on the basis of its nature. If it is organic, we can use it to make manures and if it is inorganic, we could either use the 3RS method, or simply use the incineration method, which will cause less smoke to burn down the trash.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>First idea is compost manure preparation:</b></p> <p>Biodegradable trash may be used to provide economic advantages. Composting or vermin composting may be used to turn organic waste into compost from solid waste or rubbish. Rural farmers have long used compost to generate manure. Being farmers, we should prioritize compost manure over inorganic fertilizers.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Second option is to use landfill.</b></p> <p>In landfills, garbage is buried beneath the surface of the ground. &nbsp;Pits or man-made pits are often utilized for landfilling. A well-managed landfill may be both sanitary and cost-effective for disposing of waste.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Third method is to utilize the usable trash</b></p> <p>Electricity and heat could be produced by the waste. Both the production of more energy from rubbish waste and the reduction of Nepal&apos;s garbage waste issue are enhanced as a result of this approach.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Fourth option is incineration</b></p> <p>An incinerator is a device that burns rubbish and other solid organic waste with less smoke production. This procedure is carried out in a sterile setting. This is the most used way for disposing of medical and industrial waste. The heat generated during the process may be utilized as a power source, while the ash that is left over can be used as fertilizer in agriculture. There is a potential that Nepal&apos;s garbage problem may be solved.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I am optimistic for the positive response from the respected editor and can&rsquo;t wait to see this article in your next publication.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Ram Sharma</p> <p>Inhabitant of Kathmandu Valley</p> <p><p><b>Grammar</b></p> <p> <b>Use the words from the brackets to complete the sentences.</b> &nbsp;This house is very small.

How did Hill&rsquo;s campaign gain popularity?</b> </p> <p>Environmental activist and tax redirection campaigner Julia Butterfly Hill was an American Lady. Hill&rsquo;s campaign gained popularity as a result of her 738-day living in a 180-foot-tall, about 1500-year-old California redwood tree to protest against the cutting of forest.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What made Hill start her mega campaign to save redwood trees?</b> </p> <p>Hill&apos;s mega campaign to save redwood trees was sparked by the cruel cutting of all redwood trees from California.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What kinds of amenities were there to support Hill&rsquo;s life in the tree?</b> </p> <p>Hill had very basic items with her in the tree for her survival.

How?</b> </p> <p>After her car accident, Hill&apos;s value of life really changed. As she expressed it, the event was a wake-up call and she started to raise awareness of the Redwood forest&apos;s situation by a 768 days campaign. She started prioritising the spiritual and moral virtues rather than jobs, money and social standards.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Deforestation causes natural calamities. What evidence do you have in the text to prove this</b> </p> <p>The majority of natural disasters ie. landslides and floods are caused by deforestation.

A chopper hovered perilously near to her, posing a serious threat. A neighboring tree was chopped down, Luna&apos;s outer limbs were knocked out, and she was verbally tortured and threatened with assault, rape, and death. Floodlights and air horns were used to torture her throughout the night, almost causing Hill&apos;s death.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>g.How were the vagaries of nature unwelcoming to Hill?</b></p> <p>Not only humans, but also nature tortured her. Her most terrifying experience occurred during a 16-hour windstorm at 70 mph, which was one of the worst storms to hit Northern California in decades. The coverings around her were blown apart by the wind, and even large limbs were taken off the tree. Her roof and wall were slashed by snow and lightning, leaving torn fragments behind. She had frostbite that left her feet covered in blisters.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>h.What is the purpose of the author to write a review on Hill&rsquo;s book?

Author&apos;s choice of Julia Butterfly Hill&apos;s struggle in the campaign to protect and preserve forests signifies it more. A portion of her life was given up to safeguard the redwood forest.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Critical thinking&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Suppose you are Julia Butterfly Hill. After staying one year in the tree, the government offered you five million dollars and requested you to drop the strike. Write in about 200 words responding to them that the money is a mean thing for you in comparison with the woods.</b> </p> <p>Hi, I am Julia Butterfly Hill. To keep Luna Tree safe, I&apos;ve endured many hardships, including frostbite and windstorm, as well as threats of death. Unfortunately, this offer has disappointed me a lot. I had been expecting the government would make a decision for the sake of the forest rather than trying to bribe me to stop. I didn&apos;t do it for the sake of proving myself or making a name, fame, or money for myself. My life&apos;s mission became crystal clear after my car accident. The redwood woods of California were a spiritual pilgrimage for me. Clearing the redwood forests by logging business, Luna, one of the redwood trees, was designated in blue to be taken down. It was being fought by a group of environmentalists, but they were considering calling it quits due to the approaching winter. Continued tree-sitting was necessary to save Luna from falling to her death. The next day, December 10, 1997, I made my way up the tree to resume my campaign. By working with California&apos;s Forestry Department, the logging corporation sought to slide down the cliffs on Luna. Staying in the tree prevented them from cutting it down. For a year, they attempted a variety of methods to keep me away from the tree, but none worked. None of anything could make up for letting that tree be chopped down in front of me. Even if money is nice, it can&apos;t make up for the harm that has been done by the clearing of the forests.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only way to stop me is to stop deforestation. As long as I have a Redwood forest to devote my life to, I don&apos;t need the government or 5 million Dollars. Tree-planting should be the focus of that money instead.</p> <p><br></p> <h1><b>Writing</b></h1> <p> Write a review of a book/film which you have read/watched recently. </p> <p><br></p> <p><b>A review of the movie: Pashupati Prasad</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>Director: Dependra K. Khanal</p> <p>Starring: Khagendra Lamichane, Rabindra Singh Baniya, Bipin Karki, and Barsha Shiwakoti</p> <p>Producers: Rojina Staula</p> <p>Genre: Social</p> <p>Duration: 130 minutes</p> <p>Language: Nepali</p> <p>Released date: January 29, 2016</p> <p><br></p> <p>Pashupati Prasad&apos;s narrative was written by Dependra K. Khanal. Pashupati Prasad&apos;s struggle is well shown in the film. It has shown the hardships of a common poor Nepali Youth who dreams of having a good life but is hindered by poverty. At last, a very unexpected twist happens in the movie. You should watch it once to know what happened.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br></p> <p>Pashupati (Khagendra Lamichhane) moves to Kathmandu after the huge Baisakh earthquake, which causes him to lose his family and his home in Sindhupalchowk. He has no property but he has fifty thousand dollars in debts from his father, who died in the earthquake. In Pashupatinath, he lives with Mitt Buwa, who goes through the dead bodies and collects the coins. He also goes to search for gold in the Bagmati River. He spends his time with a Hanuman (a criminal who changed his appearance to bypass the police). There is a conflict when Bhasme (Bipin Karki) tries to halt Pashupati&apos;s efforts. He also falls in love with a Mute girl (Barsha Shiwakoti) while selling second hand sarees in the street. He collects money to buy a Momo&rsquo;s cart. One day Pashupati finds a gold ring in Bagmati River and goes to sell it. But, the jeweler misuses his ignorance and calls the public blaming him that he stole his ring. The public beats him until he dies.</p> <p><br></p> <p>There will be tears in your eyes as you finish watching this heartbreaking movie. You will be able to see yourself in the protagonist&apos;s hardships. He does all he can to make a few dollars, but he fails. Moreover, how stunning the cinematography in this film is. Artists and actors that use dramatic tones in their performances, in my opinion, touch the hearts of everyone in the theater. He is a natural performer, and his performance and part in the film are captivating.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I think this is a really good film. Don&rsquo;t miss it.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Your school is going to organize a speech competition on Friday. The subject of the speech is &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s save the trees and protect our environment.&rdquo; Draft a speech using the following prompts.</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Greetings to the intellectuals, notable guests, my revered teachers, and my beloved friends this morning. My speech&apos;s title is &quot;Let&apos;s save the trees and protect our environment.&quot; Through my speech, I want to convey to you the importance of trees and forests, as well as their contribution to our lives.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Plants, and animals make up the natural world. Millions of trees and billions of live creatures exist in this environment. The whole atmosphere, soil, plants, water are equally needed by human beings and all other species and they may coexist only in a healthy environment.<br><br>Trees are one of the most vital natural resources that sustain all life on Earth. Trees help protect the natural environment by controlling pollution levels and removing toxic air from the atmosphere generated by human activities. They provide a safe haven for a large number of animals and aid in the natural process of enhancing soil fertility.</p> <p>As a thank you for all of the advantages trees bring, we selfishly take them down. We are so reliant on this natural resource that we are destroying it and causing damage to the environment in the process. There will be no place left to live on this planet if this trend of deforestation continues and people don&apos;t grasp the need of planting trees.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trees save us. So, we should start saving ourselves by planting trees in our own backyard and throughout our community. We should spread the word about the necessity of doing so. For the sake of the environment and the rest of the world, we have to do what we can without the greed of recognition.</p> <p>At last, Let&apos;s all agree to abandon this destructive practice and instead focus on reforestation. Let&rsquo;s pledge to rescue the trees and save the world!<br><br>Thank you!</p> <p><br></p> <h1><b>Grammar &nbsp;</b></h1> <p><b>Reported speech</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Someone says something to you which contradicts what they told you earlier.

is the direct translation of the Latin word &quot;curriculum vitae.&quot; In the real world, it&apos;s a record of your professional and personal accomplishments and information. It&apos;s important in one&rsquo;s career since it determines the approval when applying for employment, promotions, research funding etc.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Does the same CV work for all job opportunities? Why or why not?</b> </p> <p>Although the same CV may be used for different jobs, it is preferable to make minor adjustments to the CV based on the job description and language used in the job ad in order to showcase your most relevant skills and credentials.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the different areas where CV can help you?</b> </p> <p>In order to get a job, promotion, or research funding, a well-written CV is necessary and can be helpful. Any time when an outside professional body wants to authenticate your faculty or worth and research activities, it works as the outline. In other words, whenever someone needs to appraise your individual professional competence or the collective competence of you and your colleagues, CV can help you.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do you mean by &apos;staying CV&apos; and &apos;leaving CV&apos;? Which one would you develop for yourself as a freshman?</b> </p> <p>A &lsquo;staying CV&apos; includes a lot of work on committees and administration, as well as experiences and a solid academic record. A &lsquo; leaving CV&rsquo; will showcase your research accomplishments while also demonstrating your overall competence and willingness to perform the full range of academic obligations. As a freshman, I would create a &lsquo;leaving CV&rsquo; for myself.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How can you draft a good CV?</b> </p> <p>I can draft a good CV with all organized and necessary data, well written in a good format, adhering to the basic frame of CV. I can also seek CV writing ideas from experienced individuals to further enhance the quality of CV.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is the difference between academic CV and non-academic CV?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Academic CVs tend to be lengthier than those of non-academics, and they get longer as a person&apos;s career progresses. When non-academics apply for middle management roles, they are often encouraged to make mainly unverifiable statements about their traits and talents rather than to cite verifiable accomplishments. Thus, an academic CV differs significantly from a non-academic one.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Critical thinking</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;CV may not represent a person&rsquo;s skills and abilities accurately because one&rsquo;s confidence cannot be rendered in a paper. What do you think employers should do to find the best people for the job?</b> </p> <p>A CV may not fully reflect a person&apos;s expertise and ability since confidence cannot be shown in writing. So, the selection process should be broken down into some stages, rather than being based just on a piece of paper, in my opinion.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>First, Select the most knowledgeable candidates from the available list. The best approach to learn about someone&apos;s personality is to speak with them. Smart and communicative skills are essential for them to work well with you. Conversation is the only way to find out for sure where they went to college. Take as much time as you need to be certain. Either two or 10 interviews are required.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Decide whether or not they are capable of working alone and taking ownership of a project. They must be present at all times, both physically and mentally. They must be able to establish and maintain a commitment. Again, the best way to learn this is via discussion and, of course, references.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Then they must demonstrate that they have the necessary training, background, and credentials. Last but not least, maintaining one&apos;s composure in social situations and staying out of trouble is also crucial. SO, also consider that.</p> <p><br></p> <p>These are the things the employers should do to find the best people for the job rather than focusing on CV only.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;If the employers provide job opportunities by assessing one&rsquo;s CV, how can fresh graduates compete with the experienced competitors?</b> </p> <p>Getting ahead of the competition for your ideal job means standing out from the crowd and making a positive first impression on prospective employers by showing your talents and skills.</p> <p>There are certain jobs that need you to have an advanced degree in a specific field, but many times an employer is looking for more than simply a stellar academic record. Personality and the correct mix of interpersonal and leadership abilities are what they are looking for in prospects. When it comes to putting together an effective resume, many recent college grads are clueless. As a result, most people have resumes that follow a similar pattern since they all utilize the same template. If you want yours to stand out, you&apos;ll need to break the mold and think outside the square. As a creative candidate, you may want to go with something a little out of the ordinary in order to make your application stand out from the others. A new grad may compete with their peers if he or she does this.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Writing</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Study the following advertisement. Write an application for one of the positions.

These things became her long-term friends.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did she feel that she had traveled to &apos;a desert, to emptiness&apos; as she went to the United States?</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Due to a lack of people to share her thoughts and feelings with, she felt like she had traveled to a desert, an empty place.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did the author eventually feel that the strange city was known to her?</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>After a while, the author had the impression that the strange city was familiar to her because she never hesitated to enter any of the buildings or homes. As she walked around the strange city, she was positive about everything.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did walking make her feel at home with different places she visited?</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>As she walked, she came closer and closer to places she had seen before and new things she had observed about the surroundings. It provided her a feeling of stability and self-assurance. Even when she was at home, she held onto the memories of that day.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>[The SR Zone | www.tsz.com.np]</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Do you believe that walking helps us understand ourselves? Give reasons in support of your opinion.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Yes, I believe in it. Walking is a great way to get to know oneself better. Having a healthy brain is connected to increased cognitive performance and a better understanding of one&apos;s self through frequent walking, according to recent scientific studies.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Having a better understanding of the world around us improves our mental abilities. Walking enables us to have a better sense of the lives of the people around us. It also lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. It helps us comprehend life in a deeper way by enhancing our mood and memory.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Traveling with others educates us about their way of life and reveals to us what really matters in life. Traveling to new areas opens one&apos;s eyes to the many sides and challenges of life.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Think of one of your hobbies. How does this hobby relate to your psyche and self?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>The practice of yoga is one of my favorite hobbies. It is linked to my psyche and self because it allows me to relax while still being productive. Using it makes me look and feel better while also reducing stress.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Yoga reduces stress and anxiety and aids in coping with depression. It gives me a chance to better myself. It is a boon to our personality development because it makes us mentally strong and self-reliant by driving away obstacles in life and enhancing our inner creativity and hidden talents.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Yoga is a great way to unwind spiritually and mentally, as well as to improve one&apos;s physical and mental health. Preventing high blood pressure is a benefit, as well as improving one&apos;s overall health.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Many people turn their hobbies into careers. Is it good to turn one&apos;s hobby into a career?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Hobbies are the activities one enjoys in one&apos;s leisure time. It&apos;s no secret that many people make a living out of their hobbies and interests.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Traveling, photography, yoga, reading, fishing, handicraft, music and acting are all examples of hobbies that might lead to a career. They become well-known and wealthy on a national and worldwide scale because of their exclusive emphasis on a certain hobby.</p> <p><br></p> <p>It&apos;s a good idea to make a profession out of one&apos;s hobby because those who are passionate about their work do better. Some people thrive in photography, while others shine at singing or dancing.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Our bodies and brains benefit from hobbies because they extend our horizons, relieve stress, and refresh us after a stressful day. Because they approach their job with an open mind and do it from the heart, they have a distinct advantage in their field.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Grammar</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>[The SR Zone | www.tsz.com.np]</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Change the following sentences into passive voice.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;I want someone to love me.&nbsp; </p> <p>I want to be loved.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Someone broke into our house while we were on holiday.&nbsp; </p> <p>Our house was broken into while we were on holiday.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;I don&apos;t like people staring at me.&nbsp; </p> <p>I don&apos;t like being stared at.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Is it true that someone stole your car?&nbsp; </p> <p>Is it true that your car was stolen?&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;The cat enjoys someone tickling him.&nbsp; </p> <p>The cat enjoys being tickled.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Would Swostika open the window?&nbsp; </p> <p>Would the window be opened by Swostika?</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Did they confess the crime?&nbsp; </p> <p>Was the crime confessed by them?&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;He thinks that someone is teaching Jennie.&nbsp; </p> <p>He thinks that Jennie is being taught.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Sabina hates people laughing at her.&nbsp; </p> <p>Sabina hates being laughed at.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Complete the following sentences as in the example.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Example : People believe that one billion defaulters are staying in the UAE.&nbsp;</p> <p>The one billion defaulters are believed to be staying in the UAE.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;English people think that the number thirteen is unlucky.&nbsp; </p> <p>The number thirteen is thought to be unlucky by English people.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What are you wearing for the wedding?&nbsp; </p> <p>Actually, I am having a suit made (a suit make).

To begin with, an individual&apos;s perception of his or her existence is that he or she exists independently of others is known as the autonomous self-concept. Interdependent self-concept is characterized by a person&apos;s sense of belonging to a larger community. Both the notions of independence and dependency have advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Interdependence self-concept is based on the idea that people in a community rely on each other for existence and growth. To further implant the concept that mental growth and development is not a solitary endeavor, it provides social support for one another&apos;s progress as well. Responsibility for sharing is promoted by encouraging people to assume diverse responsibilities that contribute to society&apos;s progress and development. Fear may be overcome if you have a strong sense of self-reliance.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>In addition, it fosters a sense of community and a sense of belonging among those involved, whether on a personal or professional level. Independent self-concept is concerned with what makes a person stand apart from the rest of society in terms of his or her internal traits. Because of this, one feels better about himself or herself, which makes it easier on family, friends, and the rest of society. More so, if independence is a goal, it boosts one&apos;s self-worth and self-esteem.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Individualism increases one&apos;s self-confidence, but interdependence focuses on how individuals interact with one other and how society&apos;s current rules govern how people interact.

Individualism is defined as the power we have as individuals to do what we want, when we want. We would have a more cohesive society if everyone was free to follow their own ambitions. Individualism is becoming more prevalent in Nepalese culture.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Individualism places a high value on self-determination and self-actualization. A culture of individualism places a high value on the accomplishments of those who have made a significant contribution to society.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Nepalese culture now places a high priority on individualism. However, it should be construed positively rather than negatively. Individualism has certain advantages, including the ability to make one&apos;s own decisions. Male or female, a number of groups are attempting to provide every citizen their own unique identity.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Support for gender equality in the workplace, income, education, and political leadership is strongly linked to this kind of behavior.

This is a past incident that still bothers me.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Human life does not pass as one expects. You can have also gone through various yet noteworthy experiences. Write an essay on &apos;An Unforgettable Event in my Life&apos; in roughly 500 words.</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>&apos;An Unforgettable Event in my Life&apos;</p> <p><br></p> <p>It changed my life.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In 2019, I left for home at 10:30 after my night tuition classes. My way home was long and lonely. As I drove by, I saw four guys abusing a girl.</p> <p><br></p> <p>She was on a scooter and she braked forcefully to avoid hitting those men. They teased and stopped her. One of them instructed me to turn around and depart as I approached on my bike.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>I saw the female face as I was about to do a U-turn. Her cheeks swelled with worry and grief. She couldn&apos;t talk due to fear. I asked myself, Why do I leave her? In reality, there are four drunk guys, so I can&apos;t assist her.</p> <p><br></p> <p>These thoughts occurred to me instantly. After that, I got off my bike and raced straight to them, hitting the first guy in the stomach and throwing stones at the others. But, I could not defeat them as I am not a hero. My face, stomach, back and legs were all beaten. I shouted at the female to leave the place. She left quickly.</p> <p><br></p> <p>They continued pounding me, and I tried to defend myself but couldn&apos;t. Then they departed.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I escaped with minor bruises and no blood on my face. Then I went home and slept with pain and a smile for the first time.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Since then, I&apos;ve defended and assisted others. Protecting others does not mean fighting physically, but rather sticking up for the one in need. Help can save a life. One need not be a hero or strong to fight evil.</p> <p><br></p> <p>[The SR Zone | www.tsz.com.np]</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Grammar</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Complete these sentences with the correct prepositions.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;The relationship between the two boys has changed significantly over the past few years.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;In Nepal, many girls get married at an early age.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;I&apos;m not in the mood for such silly games.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;There were no security personnel on duty at that time.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;The new Smartphone is similar to the one I bought a few years ago.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;My dad insisted on taking the later train.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;People with ambition always try to achieve their goals, no matter what happens.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Mr. Jenkins has been disabled all his life as a result of a childhood illness.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;We bought the TV because it was for sale.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;She has no understanding of how computers really work.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;I gave him my new T-shirt in exchange for a few cigarettes.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;The company is run by two people who hardly ever meet.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;All the celebrations and parties were called off because of the tragic accident.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;There was a great need for volunteers at the site of the crash.&nbsp; </p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Complete the following text with correct prepositions.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>What are we seeing here?

The author&apos;s father&apos;s marital violence carries over into the author&apos;s life.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Forgiveness, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is the act of letting go of one&apos;s resentment against another for some mistake or wrong. To really forgive someone or anything, one must choose not to let the past influence one&apos;s current feelings toward them.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Forgetting is the opposite of remembering.&quot; However, words like this don&apos;t stay the same. True forgiveness frees the victim, not the offender, since it doesn&apos;t erase the wrongdoing.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Instead of feeling hatred against the person who has hurt you, forgiveness may bring about sentiments of understanding, empathy, and compassion for them. It provides a sense of tranquility that helps one to carry out one&apos;s daily activities.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The author interprets &apos;I am sorry&apos; as three hardest words to say.

That is applied in my life as well.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>We may either make or ruin a relationship with a simple &quot;I&apos;m sorry&quot;. We all make errors in our everyday lives, but we only ever apologize when we are ashamed of our faults. For this reason, saying these three words is among life&apos;s biggest challenges. A sincere apology can do wonders for our reputation. Apologizing for mistakes and taking responsibility for them fosters confidence in the future that this will not happen again.

In my own locale, there are many opportunities for expansion in the tourist industry.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Baglung is the name of the city where I reside. It is located in the Western Development Region of Nepal. Beautiful lakes, breathtaking mountains, and friendly people from across the planet are just some of the reasons why this place is so amazing. Baglung, a city with a rich religious and historical past, has been the major destination of all kinds of tourists ranging from religious to nature loving tourists.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Baglung&apos;s most recognizable spot is the Temple of Goddess Bhagwati, located in the city&apos;s heart. The country&apos;s tallest and longest bridge connects Baglung and Parbat. Photographing the gorgeous surroundings is an extra way to enjoy the journey.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Recently, a number of new children&apos;s amusement parks have opened, including BP Smriti Park and others. Children and teens&apos; definitions of enjoyment are being widened in a variety of ways. Minibusses, vans, and battery rickshaws are among the means of transportation that may be used to come to Baglung. There is also a semi-opened airport here. Visitors may enjoy fine dining and a comfortable bed at a few 3-star hotels here. An enormous number of tourists come here each year.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>I&apos;d appreciate it if you could help me spread the word about the booming tourism business in my hometown.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I look forward to hearing from you</p> <p>Yours faithfully.</p> <p>SR Sharma</p> <p><br></p> <p>[The SR Zone | www.tsz.com.np]</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>GRAMMAR:&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Tick the correct one.&nbsp;</b> &nbsp;He has obtained full mark/<b>marks</b>.&nbsp; &nbsp;More than two boys&nbsp;<b>were</b>/was absent.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the boy/<b>boys</b> was not found there.&nbsp; &nbsp;His wonder knew no&nbsp;<b>bounds</b>/bound.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will give you my words/<b>word</b>.&nbsp; &nbsp;He gave me much/many good&nbsp;<b>advice</b>/advices.&nbsp; &nbsp;He gave wrong&nbsp;<b>information</b>/informations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Give me two dozens/<b>dozen</b> eggs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Six miles&nbsp;<b>is</b>/are a long distance.&nbsp; &nbsp;The clock has struck four&nbsp;<b>hours</b>/hour. &nbsp;Would you lend me a ten rupees/<b>rupee</b> note?&nbsp; &nbsp;The Nepal government makes a five&nbsp;<b>year</b>/years development plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;They went to Singapore on a four days/<b>day</b> trip. </p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Which of the sentences is correct in each pair?

This made him realize he was deaf.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What psychological effects did he have when he noticed that he was being deaf?</b> </p> <p>To avoid revealing that he was deaf, he avoided social activities for two years.

The NRNs are asking for dual citizenship r</b><b>i</b><b>ghts. Do you think the Government of Nepal should address their demands?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Non-Residential Nepalis, as the name implies, are individuals who have left Nepal and are now residing in other countries (NRNS). In Nepal, this is a growing trend. Some of them have dual citizenship with the nations in which they now live in the U.S. and another country.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>People in Nepal cannot be citizens of two countries at the same time, according to the law. They have to leave one nation and give up their citizenship in order to get citizenship in another. As a result, many individuals are forced to relinquish their nationality.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Non-Resident Nepalis&apos; desires should not be addressed by the government in the sense that one should not be able to have dual citizenship in two countries at the same time. Non-Resident Nepalis, despite their love, passion, and loyalty to the nation, are not allowed to legally have dual citizenship.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Non-Resident Nepalis should not be granted citizenship as a long-term solution, but rather should be given the opportunity to work inside the country for the well-being and happiness of its population as a whole.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The NRKs celebrate festivals like Teej, Dashain, Lhosar, Id and Holi in foreign countries. What do these celebrations signify?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Non-Residential Nepalis are Nepalis who reside outside of Nepal (NRNs). Festivals like Lhosar, Id. Teej and Dashain, Holi, and many more are celebrated across the world by NRKs.</p> <p><br></p> <p>They have a strong sense of patriotism and love for their homeland. They long for their native place and all of its customs, festivals, and rituals. They are Nepalis by birth. Despite the fact that their physical bodies are in other nations, their thoughts and emotions remain in Nepal. These celebrations serve as a link to their native place for them.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Writing&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The following words and phrases are used in interpreting data of different types of charts and diagrams.

The desire to pursue work, a better life, and other considerations motivate migration to the country. The most prevalent reason for leaving the country is marriage (54%).</p> <p><br></p> <p>The low migration rate is due to a family component. That is, a different sort of familial purpose is least to blame for the flood of people entering the country. The second most popular motivation for migration is a better lifestyle. People relocate from rural to urban areas and vice versa for the same reasons. The graph shows that people relocate when their wants are not supplied locally, and that marriage is the most prevalent cause.</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Trend of death of migrant workers </p> <p><br></p> <p>The line graph shows the trend of migrant worker deaths from 2008/09 to 2017/18.

Due to her deliberate choice to focus on Western European women solely, Mary did not portray black women as goddesses in her novel.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did Lorde think that she misused her words?</b> </p> <p>Her use of Lorde&apos;s statements was seen by Lorde as an attempt to discredit Lorde as a woman of color.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;For Lorde, how were women, especially from the black community, undervalued?</b> </p> <p>According to Lorde, women of color, in particular those of the black ethnicity, were underestimated because of the patriarchal values of white women in western Europe.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does Mary take white women as? Does Lorde agree with Mary&apos;s view?</b> </p> <p>It is Mary&apos;s belief that white women are the real source of power and background for all females, whereas non-white women&apos;s history are only notable as instances of female oppression. Lorde disagrees with Mary&apos;s point of view because she believes that Mary has shown the superiority of white feminism over black feminism by treating black people as if they were ornaments and neglecting their suffering and oppression. Lorde believes that Mary&apos;s position is inherently racist.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is Afrekete? How does it connect to this lesson?</b> </p> <p>Afrekete is the voice of black lesbian literary tradition. This lesson &quot;An Open Letter to Mary Daly&quot; is linked to this one in the sense that the author wishes to unite all the black women in the arena of black literature by using this method of communication.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;&quot;The oppression of women knows no ethnic or racial boundaries.&quot; Do you agree or not? Justify with your reasons.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>&quot;The oppression of women recognizes no ethnic or racial limits, but that does not imply it is similar within those divisions,&quot; wrote Black poet and feminist writer Audre Lorde. Sexual orientation and socioeconomic standing all affect how women and girls see the world. With the recent outbreak of the Corona virus in the US, gender and racial inequities have been starkly emphasized. Women of color work as grocery store clerks, postal carriers, food delivery drivers, bus drivers, farmhands, and warehouse laborers. Women&apos;s experiences differ because they face comparable issues.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Writing&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Have you ever faced or witnessed cases of racial or sexual discrimination? Write a short account.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>When people treat someone less favorably because of their race or ethnicity or skin color, this is called &quot;racial discrimination.&quot; Gender discrimination happens when a person is treated unfairly because of their sex.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>I want to share a incident regarding racial discrimination. 3 tourists came to our village for camping. Those were three friends among which one was from africa. Every child in our village took photos with the other two but nobody wanted to take photos or talk with that African guy. I felt so sad and went to him, talked with him and took some photos. This was very bad form of racism.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an article for a national daily on &quot;The Status of Women in Nepali Society.&quot;&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>The Status of Women in Nepali Society&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Women&apos;s status varies according to geography, caste, economy, religion, and social structure. Nepal&apos;s standing as a country for women cannot be praised highly enough. More than 60% of women are uneducated.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In principle, they are equal under the constitution, but in practice, they are not. They cannot participate in public affairs because of the dominant cultural mindset. They have remained hidden because of the caste system, traditional eating customs, and the focus on virginity.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Among their chores include cooking, laundry, and kid care. Family breadwinners are males, whereas women are only considered as domestic and maternity carers. Women must work at home. Hindu women are meant to be financially dependent on males from birth to death. Household duties include gathering wood and fuel for fireplaces, transporting water, gardening, and assisting males and other family members.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Nepalese women are also pushed into prostitution and sold as commercial sexworkers due to harsh legislation. They work 16 hours a day in agriculture, carpet manufacturing, and wage labor.</p> <p><br>In a nutshell, Mahatma Gandhi said that man and woman are the two wheels of a cart that must operate together. Mothers in particular guide the rest of the family. As a consequence, without adequate education and economic rights for women, the family cannot flourish.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>@Shriram Lamichhane | The SR Zone</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>GRAMMAR:&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>ADJECTIVE ORDER&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Choose the correct alternative.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;an old foreign car / a foreign old &ccedil;ar&nbsp; </p> <p>An old foreign car&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a beautiful white dress<i>/&nbsp;</i>a white beautiful dress&nbsp; </p> <p>A beautiful white dress&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a nice tail young manla tall nice young man&nbsp; </p> <p>A nice tall young man&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a big black wooden desk/ a black wooden big desk&nbsp; </p> <p>A big black wooden desk&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a delicious Italian pizza / an Italian delicious pizza&nbsp; </p> <p>A delicious Ttattant pizza&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a huge brown bear / A brown huge bear&nbsp; </p> <p>A huge brown bear&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a purple cotton sleeping bag / a cotton purple sleeping bag&nbsp; </p> <p>A purple cotton sleeping bag&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a beautiful old Indian village / an old beautiful Indian village&nbsp; </p> <p>An old beautiful Indian village&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;a cute little kitten/ a little cute kitten&nbsp; </p> <p>A cute little kitten&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;an expensive antique&nbsp;<i>l</i>an antique expensive table&nbsp; </p> <p>An antique expensive table&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Put the adjectives in the following sentences in the correct order.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;I bought&nbsp;<i>/a /c</i>omfortable/new) scooter.&nbsp; </p> <p>I bought a comfortable new red scooter.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;She reached home and sat on (relaxing/old<i>/</i>he<i>r/</i>wooden) hair.&nbsp; </p> <p>She reached home and sat on her old wooden relaxing chair.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;We ate (Chinese<i>/</i>delicious<i>/</i>some) food.&nbsp; </p> <p>We ate some delicious Chinese food.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;I need (golden<i>/</i>delicious<i>/</i>some<i>/</i>round) apples.&nbsp; </p> <p>I need some delicious round golden apples.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;We like to live in a (calm/unmediated<i>/</i>remote) place for some time.&nbsp; </p> <p>We would like to live in a calm unmediated remote place for&nbsp;</p> <p>some time.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;She is wearing (silver<i>/</i>beautiful / a(n)<i>/&nbsp;</i>old) ring.&nbsp; </p> <p>She is wearing a beautiful old silver ring.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;I am looking for (golden<i>/</i>stylish<i>/a/</i>Japanese) leather watch.&nbsp; </p> <p>I am looking for a stylish golden Japanese leather watch.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;She dropped (old/china/attractive<i>/</i>a<i>(</i>n)) cup and smashed it.&nbsp; </p> <p>She dropped an attractive old China cup and smashed it.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;He wants to marry a (young/pretty<i>/</i>educated/a(n)/rustic) girl.&nbsp; </p> <p>He wants to marry a pretty young educated rustic girl.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> &nbsp;We stayed in a (luxurious/fi<i>v</i>e star/new) hotel in Dubai.&nbsp; </p> <p>We stayed in a new luxurious five-star hotel in Dubai.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Stay Connected with us:</b></p> <p><b>Facebook: fb.com/thesrzone</b></p> <p><b>YouTube: youtube.com/thesrzone</b></p> <p><b>Website:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"http://www.tsz.com.np\"><b>www.tsz.com.np</b></a></p> <p>"

A Macedonian family next door and a Polish widower next door make them angry.</p> <p><br></p> <p>They attempt to avoid them. Their new neighbours do things that are a little weird and a little dirty, which makes them a little uneasy at first. People in the next door don&apos;t like that their dog is outside or that the young man stays inside while his wife works outside.</p> <p><br></p> <p>People in the young couple&apos;s neighbourhood help them out over time. They help with their kitchen garden and henhouse. Now, they are happy and love their neighbours. In their minds, the people next to them aren&apos;t bad. They start to talk and learn with their neighbours. They are happy to live there.</p> <p><br></p> <p>When the young woman gets pregnant, her neighbours start cheering and giving her help, gifts, and advice right away. Everyone in the neighbourhood is having a good time. The young couple hasn&apos;t been used to it. He is shocked when his neighbours welcome a new baby boy. Finally, the young man weeps as his neighbours cheer for his baby&apos;s birth. He realises that the view of migrants is wrong.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The story shows that people from different countries can live together happily even though they speak different languages, have different customs, and live different lives.

Their house was not that luxurious or of High-standard but was perfectly cosy to live a life as a normal person.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did the young couple recognize their neighbours in the beginning of their arrival?</b> </p> <p><b>=</b>The young couple recognized their neighbours as uncivilized and annoying people in the beginning of their arrival from various odd activities that they witnessed. People in their surrounding used to scream, quarrel, make unnecessary noises. They also lack proper sanitation. They used to complain about their dog. They used to interfere with their household activities.&nbsp;</p> <p>All these things made them have a negative impression about their neighbourhood in the beginning of their arrival.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did the neighbours assist the young couple in the kitchen garden?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Neighbours helped them both orally and physically in their kitchen garden. Orally, they gave them some advice that was required to have proper benefits from gardening. They approached the work area and offered and advised them the ideas for spacing, hilling and mulching the vegetables they had planted. They provided them with some seeds and plants of vegetables as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus they assist the young couple in the kitchen garden.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why were the people in the neighbourhood shocked at the role of the young man and his wife in their family?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The people in the neighbors were shocked by the actions of a young couple which was new to them. They were astonished to see that the young guy stayed at home and took care of domestic chores, while his wife worked at a hospital. It was frowned upon in the neighborhood for men to sit at home while women worked outside.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did the neighbours respond when they learned about the woman&rsquo;s pregnancy?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b> The neighbors reacted to the woman&apos;s pregnancy with grace and politeness. They began smiling at the young couple all the time and showing a lot of concern for the young lady. They did all they could to help her in different ways. They gave her numerous presents, counsel, and attention in connection with her pregnancy.</p> <p>Neighbours showed their joy and happiness through various activities. Some people started offering them presents, hand-knitted sweaters, gloves, caps, some women started advising them baby names, some started guessing the child whether it will be a boy or a girl.&nbsp;</p> <p>From all these, we can infer that the people in the neighbourhood were very happy to learn about the woman&apos;s pregnancy.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did the young man begin to cry at the end of the story?</b> </p> <p><b>= &nbsp;</b>At the conclusion of the story, the young man cried, realizing his neighbor&apos;s concern, care, and affection. When he found people applauding for his newly born kid, he couldn&apos;t conceal his feelings. He cried with joy at his neighbours&apos; happiness. His view of his neighbors changed. He was able to understand the concept of interpersonal interactions.</p> <p>Angry and annoyed by their neighbor&apos;s interferences into their personal lives, the young couple had become resentful of their neighbors. They were unaware that all of their neighbors&apos; actions were motivated by love and concern for them. Their relationship changes when the Young Lady becomes pregnant and their neighbors start admiring and wishing them well. This story&apos;s last scene depicts a young man&apos;s tears of gratitude for his neighbors&apos; kindness.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did the author not characterize the persons in the story with proper names?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The author did not give the characters a definitive name or identity because he wanted to represent individuals from various cultures and languages living together in peace. The author wants the reader to get influenced or inspired from the story by characterizing the persons of the story without finite names.</p> <p>Second reason could be, Tim may not want his readers to get too involved in the characters, rather feel the way people interact with each other in a diversified community.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The story depicts that linguistic and cultural barriers do not create any obstacles in human relationships. Explain with some examples from this story where the neighbours have transcended such barriers.</b> </p> <p>= In the story, language and cultural differences do not hinder human connections. In this story, their neighbours help the young couple with their kitchen garden even though they don&apos;t understand their language. Even though they don&apos;t speak Macedonian, a Macedonian family educates them to yell. Helping an old Polish man restore his chicken coop may be considered as noble. It is a fantastic illustration of a human connection when they show care, love, and respect for the young pregnant woman.</p> <p><br>The couple&apos;s realization allows them to explore a new chapter of their life when they discover they&apos;re pregnant. They shared a culture but not a language. After a period of adaptation, the pair blended in well. The anecdote shows that language and cultural barriers do not prevent human engagement.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The last sentence of the story says &ldquo;The twentieth-century novel had not prepared him for this.&rdquo; In your view, what differences did the young man find between twentieth-century novels and human relations?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b> A statement from the conclusion, &quot;The twentieth-century book had not prepared him for this,&quot; indicates that he has come to believe that the twentieth-century viewpoint on immigration was incorrect.&nbsp;</p> <p>The young man realizes at the story&apos;s end that twentieth-century literature had not fully prepared him for real life. He was startled to realize that twentieth-century fiction and actual relationships differed significantly. He formed an opinion about migrants&apos; lives while writing his thesis on a novel set in the 1920s. Sick of dealing with immigrants in his new area, he had almost decided to leave the area. In the end, his view of twentieth-century novels was mistaken.</p> <p>It was unexpected. He was moved to tears by migrants&apos; actions and realized the value of mankind. Human interactions are considerably more relatable than things written about in books, he realized.</p> <p>A lot of unexpected things occurred in the young man&apos;s life. His neighbors showed their love and joy, he sobbed seeing such nice neighbours. All of this was possible due to their great neighbour relations. The human connection let him realize the value of living in a community.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;A Nepali proverb says &ldquo;Neighbors are the companions for the wedding procession as well as for the funeral procession.&rdquo; Does this proverb apply in the story? Justify.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b> A Nepali proverb says &ldquo;Neighbors are the companions for the wedding procession as well as for the funeral procession.&rdquo; defines the social harmony and relationship that the people in the Nepali community have with each other.&nbsp;</p> <p>If someone has a marriage, people go there to help with arrangements, not only to celebrate. We can say it is almost impossible to conduct such ceremonies without the help of neighbours in our society. (Unless they go to some Party Palaces or hotels for arrangement). Similarly, if something unexpected or sad happens in one family, every family in society becomes ready to share the grief.&nbsp;</p> <p>This proverb is also applicable in this story. When they were gardening, neighbours came there to help them with various suggestions, including giving them various materials and seeds for planting different vegetables. Similarly, they also give them an idea of how they can grow more and well. This proves that Neighbours helped them when there was a time they required.</p> <p>On the other hand, They are also assisted by their neighbours when they have a happy and pleasant moment. Having a baby is a good moment, where every one of their neighbours come there to celebrate and be the participant of their happiness. This implies the Nepali proverb of &quot;Neighbours are the companions for the wedding procession as well as for the funeral procession&quot;.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The author has dealt with an issue of multiculturalism in the story. Why do you think multiculturalism has become a major issue in the present world?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Multiculturalism is a mix of cultures. Communication is a major barrier to adjusting to new situations and building connections with people from various cultures. Because of this, I think inter-ethnic prejudice will exist and it deepens the chasm.</p> <p><br></p> <p>People don&apos;t meet because their lives are so diverse. Mostly, concepts like &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;human connections&quot; are obsolete in such societies. This sense of diversity generates damage and discrimination in all areas. This idea has led to numerous disastrous results. This kind of thinking is harmful to our world.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In conclusion, multiculturalism has many flaws.</p> <p> Language Differences Social instability Social divisions Issues at Workplaces </p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay on Celebration of Childbirth in my Community.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The ninth day of birth (Nwaran) is a joyous celebration of a child&apos;s birth among family and community members.</p> <p>My culture celebrates birth. The birth of a child brings joy to the whole family and friends. A new baby brings joy to the whole family. Guests congratulate the newlyweds. They are delighted to meet the mother and her new-born.</p> <p>The infant is named that day. It is a community event. A townspeople came to congratulate the parents and family. They also sing, dance, and consume excellent meals.</p> <p>Having a baby shower before the baby is born is not our norm, thus I oppose this new trend. Other cultures&apos; celebrations of anti-traditional conduct have influenced our society. Every year, an older relative or a member of the community blesses a child&apos;s birth. People offer presents and pleasantries.</p> <p>This has aided social bonding.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Do the people in your community respond with similar reactions upon the pregnancy and childbirth as depicted in the story? Give a couple of examples.</b> </p> <p><b>=</b>Yes, they do. People in our society are very responsive and cooperative. Not only do they respond to some neighbour&apos;s happy moments but all are ready to help all people in the community. This has helped people to strengthen their relationships.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our culture values pregnancy and birth. This commemorative ritual includes the entire family and the neighborhood. Mothers are respected more throughout pregnancy and childbirth. She is loved and cherished.</p> <p>Well-wishers from families pray for the mother&apos;s and baby&apos;s health during pregnancy. That&apos;s why I admire it. People around her regularly offer her health advice. Her family treats her well. So, she receives plenty of presents and privileges. Everyone respects and likes her.</p> <p>A child&apos;s birth is a momentous affair. Everyone in the family and the whole community becomes excited when a kid is born. Guests congratulate the parents on the baby&apos;s first cry. They all rejoice for the new-born baby. The whole family welcomes and cares for the new mother and the baby.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> <p>Presented by: Shriram Lamichhane</p> <p>Like us on facebook: fb.com/thesrzone</p> <p>Follow us on instagram: instagram.com/the_sr_zone</p> <p><b><i>Download Link for these notes given in the website - tsz.com.np!</i></b></p> <p><br></p>"

      "title": "A Respectable Woman",
      "story": " <p><b>Summary</b></p> <p> Gaston Broda Mrs. Broda Gouvernail </p> <p>When Mrs. Baroda learns that her husband&apos;s friend Gouvernail is going to spend a week or two at their plantation, she becomes a little upset. After all, they had been busy all winter, and she had hoped to use the time to relax and talk with her husband Gaston Baroda, and have some good time with him.&nbsp;</p> <p>She has never met Gouvernail, despite the fact that she is aware that Gouvnernail and her husband were friends in college and that he is now a successful journalist. She has a mental image of him as a tall, slender, and cynical guy, and she does not care for this mental image.&nbsp;</p> <p>A paradoxical thing happens after that. When she meets Gouvernail, who is slim but neither tall nor cynical, she discovers that she really likes him.</p> <p>Mrs. Baroda wonders why she loves Gouvernail since he makes no special effort to impress her in any other way, She does not recognize any of the good characteristics mentioned by Gaston as being there.&nbsp;</p> <p>He loves sitting on the field and listening to Gaston explaining sugar plantation methods. He does not seem to be very bright, but he does appear calm and polite. &nbsp;</p> <p>Mrs. Baroda finds Gouvernail to be a little confusing, yet she finds him to be charming and unoffensive. Unlike what she had thought of him, she finds him way better than she expected.</p> <p>She first leaves him alone with her husband, but she soon starts to join him on walks as she tries to overcome his solitary habits. Gouvernail behaved quite simply and didn&apos;t pay much attention to Mrs. Baroda. Mrs. Baroda found various deficiencies within him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her husband informs her that he will be staying for another week and inquires as to why she does not want him to remain longer with her. Mrs. Baroda expresses surprise at Gaston&apos;s arrival, by saying that she expected him to be more fascinating. Gaston finds it amusing that she replies by saying she would like him to be more interesting.</p> <p>Later that night, she sits alone on a bench, feeling befuddled and wanting to get away from the plantation for a time. She has informed her husband that she intends to go to the city in the morning and stay with her aunt while on leave.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gouvernail entered and took a seat next to her. On Gaston&apos;s behalf, he presented her with a scarf. He began to speak about the night, the olden days, and his preference for calm existence.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the first time, Mrs. Baroda saw him talking. She didn&apos;t pay attention to his words, but she was drawn to the tones of his voice. She longed to extend her hand towards him and place her delicate fingers on his face or lips. She wanted to kiss his cheek and mumble something sweet. She kept her cool, however. Her self-respect as a respectable woman and housewife kept her from making this awful blunder. She rose up and walked away from the scene.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mrs. Baroda wants to inform Gaston about her odd misadventure, but she recognizes with a maturity that she must deal with this emotion on her own.&nbsp;</p> <p>She goes for the city the next morning and does not return until Gouvernail has left the city.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite Gaston&apos;s best efforts, Gouvernail refuses to come back the next summer. In the end, she changes her mind, much to the pleasure of her husband, who informs her that Gouvernail did not deserve her unreasonable dislike in the first place.&nbsp;</p> <p>She tells her husband, adding that she would now treat him with greater hospitality. And The story ends here.</p> <p>There is no assurance at the conclusion of the narrative; we don&apos;t know if she will choose her emotions or overcome them. In this manner, Kate Chopin challenges us; being respectable entails adhering to societal conventions or living a life free of regret.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br><br></p> <h2><b>Exercise</b></h2> <p><b>Understanding the text&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why was Mrs. Baroda not happy with the information about Gouvernail&rsquo;s visit to their farm?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Mrs. Broda was not happy with the information about Gouvernail&rsquo;s visit to their farm because she had worked long hours on the sugar plantation throughout the winter and was looking forward to spending time with her husband. Furthermore, she was anxious about Gouvernail coming to their property since he was a total stranger to her.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How was Gouvernail different from Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s thinking?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Gouvernail was drastically different from Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s thinking because she had thought him to be a tall, skinny, unsociable and unlikable guy. He wasn&apos;t the tall, skeptical man as she had expected him to be. He didn&apos;t wear spectacles and wasn&apos;t at all what she expected. When she met her, she had a completely different impression of him because she didn&apos;t think he was bright or intelligent.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does Mrs. Baroda compare the guest - Gouvernail with her husband?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Mrs. Baroda compares Gouvernail as not interesting, adaptive, friendly, interactive, and funny like her husband Gaston.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why and how did Mrs. Baroda attempt to change Gouvernail&rsquo;s solitary habits?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Mrs. Broda wanted to change his solitary habit because she wanted Gouvernail to be more open and talkative to her. Despite Mrs. Baroda&apos;s efforts, Gouvernail ignored her. He enjoyed his lonely lifestyle and his preference for being alone.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mrs. Baroda hoped to entice him away from his lonely tendencies by accompanying him on his excursions to the mill and along the river.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does Gaston not agree with his wife on Gouvernail&rsquo;s character?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Gaston disagrees with his wife on Gouvernail&apos;s Character by forwarding his opinions to her. She has reported to him that Gouvernail was not a friendly, talkative and interesting guy. He replies that Gouvernail is a very good and respectable person, He explains that he has many bright and outstanding qualities, but he has been disturbed by the work overload and she should not mistreat him.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why is Gaston surprised by his wife&rsquo;s expression towards the end of the story?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Gaston is surprised by his wife&apos;s expression in the end because, the woman who was blaming Gouvernail for being less - sociable, uninteractive, self-centred, gloomy, unlikable earlier was later ready to welcome him again and be more hospitable.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>&nbsp;Reference to the context&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is the reason for conflict in Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s mind? What role does Mrs. Baroda &nbsp;&lsquo;being a respectable woman&rsquo; play in this story?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The cause of the conflict in Mrs. Baroda&apos;s mind is that she has started liking her husband&apos;s friend.&nbsp;</p> <p>Being a respectable woman, She has to protect her pride of being a woman. Even, the primary topic of this story is desire vs discipline. Her wish to show her affections for Gouvernail is blocked by societal norms, which prevent her from doing so.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, the feeling of being a respectable woman controls her urges and feelings for him.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Sketch the character of Gouvernail and contrast it with Gaston.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>We learn about Gouvernail through his outside portrayal that he is Gaston&apos;s college buddy, who is now working as a journalist, who is an unsociable and less-interactive guy and that he is a heavy smoker.</p> <p>Gouvernail is an introverted type of guy, who does not talk much and who is simply boring from the view of Mrs. Baroda, while Gaston is a sociable and friendly guy.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does Mrs. Baroda not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Mrs. Baroda does not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail with her husband because Mrs. Baroda does not want to deviate from the ideal of being a respectable woman. Being respectable means living according to social norms or living our lives without regret.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The last three sentences of the story make a kind of twist. After reading these three sentences, how will you analyze Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s attitude towards Gouvernail?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>When Mrs. Baroda tells Gouvernail, &quot; I have overcome everything! This time I will be really kind to him,&quot; the story takes an unexpected twist.</p> <p>Mrs. Baroda&apos;s statement at first glance seems that she has regained control of her emotions. Her victory over &quot;everything&quot; suggests that she has overcome not just her discontent with Gouvernail, but also her intellectually bankrupt emotional feelings for him.</p> <p>But, on the other hand, from Mrs. Baroda&apos;s rejection of society&apos;s norms, it can imply that Mrs. Baroda learned more about her own wants and desires as a woman.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The entry of an outsider into a family has been a recurring subject in both literature and movies.

He also felt a feeling of obligation as a doctor and wished his father a long life. As a result, Mr. Varma&apos;s diet concerns are justified.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did Varma couples make sacrifices for their son&rsquo;s higher education?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> The Varmas had labored forty years in a kerosene warehouse, while their wife ran the house. The Varma family labored tirelessly to fund their son&apos;s further education. They had always aspired for the best for their son&apos;s education.</p> <p>Mr. Varma couldn&apos;t pursue his studies since he was a vegetable seller&apos;s kid. But he wanted to educate his son Rakesh. After a time, he accomplished his dream and fulfilled his aspirations. Mr. and Mrs. Varma were rewarded for their patience as Rakesh became the family&apos;s first college graduate. So, Mr. and Mrs. Varma&apos;s sacrifice to educate their son Rakesh was extraordinary.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Mr. Varma suffers from diseases one after another after his wife&rsquo;s death. Would he have enjoyed better health if she had not died before him? Give reasons.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= Yes, Mrs. Verma&apos;s existence would have improved Mr. Varma&apos;s health. Rakesh was happy and busy in his own lifestyle. So, no one could care for his father like his mother did. When his wife died, he was left alone. His body began to respond weirdly when his wife died. Varma had a strange illness that made him unwell.</p> <p>Rakesh had no clue what was wrong. Varma was doing well till his wife lived. After his wife died, he began acting strangely. His son prevented him from eating his favorite meals. He was thought to be hated and disregarded. Finally, he decided that death beats using medicines to live. In a simple sense, he&apos;d be happier now if his wife hadn&apos;t died.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Dr. Rakesh is divided between a doctor and a son. As a son, he loves his father and worries about his weakening health but as a doctor he is strict on his father&rsquo;s diet and medicine. In your view, what else could Rakesh have done to make his father&rsquo;s final years more comfortable?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>As a son, Rakesh loves his father and worries about his weakening health but as a doctor he is strict on his father&rsquo;s diet and medicine. Despite his Job and responsibilities, he had devoted himself to take care of his father in his final years. But, I think, He could have made him more at ease by doing something more.&nbsp;</p> <p>He would have respected his father instead of shouting at him. Instead of being harsh, he would have tried to always make his father pleased. Instead of worrying about his father&apos;s health, he should have tried to understand him. He should have offered his father emotional assistance.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the story say about the relationship between grandfather and grandchildren?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>= &nbsp;The story says that Grandparents and grandchildren often have close connections in households.In this story, Mr. Varma uses his little grandchild to obtain what he wants. He starts paying his grandson to bring him jalebis. This story shows a lovely bond between a grandfather and his grandchildren. Varma&apos;s closest friends are his grandchildren. Rakesh&apos;s actions have made him sad instead. His grandsons are his closest friends, with whom he plays and spends his time alone.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Do you call Rakesh a devoted son? Give reasons.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Yes, I call Rakesh absolutely a devoted son. I have following reason to claim my opinion;&nbsp;</p> <p> After successfully completing studies in the US, He rejects the golden job opportunities there and returns to homeland to continue his job along with continuing to serve and take care for parents. Instead of marrying, an educated women, he marries illiterate rural women, so that she could give time to Rakesh&apos;s parent&nbsp; Till the last breath of his mother, Rakesh was the one who held her hands and did everything he could do to save his mother. Being a doctor and &amp; owning a family, Rakesh had a very tight schedule, still he manages to take care of his father. When father fell ill, he banned oily foods for him, because they were not healthy for him, spent most of his time with father, brought high-quality and effective tonics and medicines, behaved humbly and paid respect every time and did his best efforts possible to give him longer span.&nbsp; </p> <p>Thus, As the line suggests, Rakesh is undoubtedly a devoted son.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay on The Parents&rsquo; Ambition for their Children in Nepali Society.

The story moves ahead to show how power and greed corrupt human beings. &nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Evans and Hooker are two greedy person.&nbsp;Chang-hi discovered a Spanish ship&apos;s treasure and buried it in a dense forest. Evans and Hooker and stole his map of treasure. Hooker reviewed the map. One aspect of the map catches their attention: a section of the map was covered with tiny dashes going in every direction. They couldn&apos;t figure out what was causing the dashes. Even though the map was not very accurate, the shape of the island could be clearly seen.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <p>Hooker put the map away and started paddling although he was so tired. Then, he sat down and started taking a short nap. Evans closed his eyes and dreamt of treasure and Chang Hi.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p> <p>He spotted them both in the woods at night. They saw a fire in the trees. They both spotted three Chinese-men discussing quietly about the treasure in front of a fire. Their accent was Chinese English. Hooker first heard them. They came closer to hear them more clear. Chang hi was telling his friends about the island&apos;s buried treasure. Chang Hi had hid the gold during a Spanish shipwreck. Chang hi wanted his friends to assist him find the buried treasure. He had a treasure map. The narrative of Chang hi was golden opportunity for Evans and Hooker. Then, Evans&apos; dream shifted suddenly. He visualized that he snatched his map and made him silent. Evans later saw a lot of gold. Then, he dreamt that Chang hi opened his eyes and smiled a scary and mysterious expression. Chang hi said &quot;Evans&quot;.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Hooker made Evans awake saying &quot;Evans, Evan&apos;s, you fool... Hooker was screaming when Evans opened his eyes. He was surprised to find himself near the shore.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the jungle, he was told by Hooker that there were three palm trees. He told him that if they found the palm trees, they could easily find the treasure.</p> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Evans and Hooker find the spot indicated on the map and go by boat through the jungle for some time. They quickly come upon the identifying mound of stones that fits the description on the map.</p> </p> <p><br></p> <p>They find a dead man&apos;s body there. They thought that he had also dug a hole for the treasure there as well. When they discovered several gold nuggets in the partly dug hole, they started collecting the gold pieces to return them to the boat, but he is immediately injured by a thorn. After a short distance, Evans&apos; arms begin to ache, he sweats, and he begins to feel pain.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Evan suggests Hooker to run away. Hooker doesn&apos;t obey Evan and he start to load as much gold as they can inside Evans&apos; jacket before. Then, Hooker arms also get ached, he got hurt, and he began to suffer the pain.&nbsp;He then begins shaking on the ground. Now, he also gets poisoned by the thorns while collecting the gold.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Both of them are pricked by a thorn, now he understands the meaning of the tiny dashes on the map; Chang-hi had surrounded his wealth with thorns. As a result of the Chinaman&apos;s protecting thorns, Hooker and Evans are both badly hurt. They&apos;re exhaling their last gasps of air.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>He glanced at Evans, who remained still. His eyes were open but not moving.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Hooker began sucking his finger vainly. He began having hand, arm, and neck pain. He couldn&apos;t move his fingers. He dreamed Chang hi&apos;s happy expression. He glanced down, then up at Evans. A breeze blew through the trees. A big white flower fell from one of them and landed in front of him.</p> <p><br></p> <p>When the story concludes, we see Evans and Hooker laying in suffering next to each other, awaiting their deaths.</p> <p><br></p> </p> <h3>What are the themes of this story?</h3> <p>The story&apos;s themes include foresight, safety, suspense, greed, temptation, and destruction.</p> <p><br></p> <h3>Moral of the story:</h3> <p>The main moral / message of &quot;The Treasure in the forest&quot; is that the path of greed and crime is always destructive. Another most important lesson is caution. We must prepare ahead of time before going there to achieve the expected outcome. So, before making a choice, we must concentrate on and understand. The outcome of greed would be awful. In addition, it reveals the vulnerability of money and wealth.&nbsp;</p> <b>Exercise</b><br><p><b>Understanding the text</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Describe the expository scene of the story.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>In the expository scene of the story, we see two characters, Evans and Hooker, sailing in the boat, holding a map in hand, and were seen perplexed as they did not understand the map. They were approaching a land nearby, which was a dense forest.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the map look like and how do Evan and Hooker interpret it?</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> The map was a little bit torn, and since it was older, the paper was also unclear. Somehow, they succeed in decoding the symbols in the map. They make their destination to the dotted lines area, which according to them, is the place where the treasure was hidden.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did Evan and Hooker know about the treasure?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Evan and Hooker had known about the treasure that was buried and protected by Chang-hi in a secret place while the Chinese man was having the chit chat with his three friends in the jungle. The Chinese men were talking about the treasure in an English accent in front of a roaring fire. Evans and Hooker sneaked up behind them and eavesdropped on their plot to locate the hidden treasure.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Describe Evan&rsquo;s dream.</b> </p> <p>Evan daydreamed while on his boat and it was a pretty strange dream. After closing his eyes, he was shocked to discover many pictures in his dream. He got the vision of himself and Hooker when they were searching for something in the forest. An English accent conversation between three Chinese men about the forests&apos; riches drew their attention. Their pals moved closer to them to better hear them. A Chinese man was talking to them about Spanish treasures.&nbsp;</p> <p>There was a battle between them in which Chang-hi was killed. After some silence, Chang-hi suddenly burst out laughing. Evan saw a big devil-like Chang-hi with a massive black tail in the center of a pile of gold, calling his name.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do the two treasure hunters see when they walk towards the island?</b> </p> <p>The two treasure hunters, Evans and Hooker saw three palm palms, a large number of plants and inside it, a semi decayed dead body of a Chinese guy lying face down on the grass.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;In what condition did the treasure hunters find the dead man?</b> </p> <p><b>=</b>The treasure hunters found the dead man in a swollen and partially spoiled state. They slowly approached the corpse, cutting big white blossoms and thick bushes. When Evans inspected the deceased&apos;s body, he found that he was a Chinese man. Only a few gold ingots were scattered around his deceased&apos;s body.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did the treasure hunters try to carry gold ingots to the canoe?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>They wanted to carry as much as gold as they could to the boat. So, they filled their jackets with gold ingots and started delivering it to the boat. Doing so, Evans feels the thorn poisonous prick and soon starts dying in the pain. Hooker was still hungry for the gold and treasure, so he assembled the scattered gold ingots and started carrying them to the canoe. However, both get brutally hurt at the end of the story.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How were Evan and Hooker poisoned?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Chang-Hi had protected the treasure with poisonous thorns as indicated in the map with Dashes(---). While carrying the ingots to canoe, Evans feels the arm ache and falls to the ground. But he stills suggests Hooker take them to canoe. But, When Hooker starts carrying them again, he also feels a thorn prick and gets poisoned. Hooker&apos;s thumb was pierced by a thin thorn, and eventually, both got poisoned.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How do you know the story is set on a tropical island?</b> </p> <p>I can say with certainty that the story is set on a tropical island because of the vegetation found there and the fact that the people in this story seem weary and thirsty as a result of their long nighttime journey and the intense heat on the island. Island is also abandoned by humans, and is desolate because the temperature on the tropical island is very hot. A tropical island will have dense shrubs and large white blooms like those the characters encounter on their journey. So, the narrative is set on a tropical island, with palm palms, thorny plants, seagrass, and other marine life.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why do you think Evan and Hooker took such a risk of finding the buried treasure on a desert island?</b> </p> <p>Evans and Hooker, in my view, took such a risk by seeking for undiscovered treasure on a remote island because they wanted to become wealthy.</p> <p>As soon as Greed wins, a person is able to handle any challenge. They kill a Chinese guy while attempting to take his map. They&apos;re on the lookout for a fantastic opportunity in order to raise their standard of living. Financial constraints may have motivated them to take the risk.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Do you think the narrator of the story is racist? If yes, what made him feel superior to other races?</b> </p> <p>Yes, I think the narrator is racist. We can infer the treatment of his characters has been slanted because of his racism. The way he addresses his audience is asymmetrical. Characters are referred to using racial or ethnic slurs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two English Men are shown as being superior and dominating to the Chinese men in the story. He had provided the proper names and emphasized the english characters but, the chinese characters seem to have a very minor onstage role in this story. So, racial differences are evident in his depictions of the people.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do you think is the moral of the story?</b> </p> <p>The moral of the story, &ldquo;The treasure in the forest by HG Wells&rdquo; is that we should avoid pursuing greed and power at all costs, or it will end up very bad. It also teaches to have a foresight and long term visionary plans before starting anything. One&apos;s desire for power and wealth has terrible consequences. In the story, two Englishmen were killed because of their thirst for money and disregard for the moral and legislative laws. It&apos;s advisable to stay away from both greed and power since they&apos;re both destructive.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference Beyond Text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Interpret the story as a mystery story.</b> </p> <p>A mystery story piques readers&apos; attention. All of the elements of a good mystery may be found in HG Wells&apos; story of a treasure in the forest. A mystery has suspense, a vital witness, fascinating settings, misdirections, and other puzzle pieces to resolve. This story also carries upon this subject.</p> <p>The story&apos;s characters are well-developed, and their circumstances are unpredictable. This narrative kept the audience guessing from start to finish.</p> <p>Evans and Hooker sail in the boat with a certain objective after getting the map of treasure from Chang-hi&rsquo;s assasination. The story advances by following the map&apos;s and characters&apos; suggestions. The story describes the characters and the environment well. It&apos;s hard to keep track of what&apos;s going on.</p> <p>Alternatively, the storyline is a mystery. The mystery behind treasure and mystery behind the dashes of the map all contribute to making it a mystery story. The poisonous thorns killed them in the end. The story&apos;s creepy forest setting and tragic deaths keep readers on edge.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Treasure hunting is a favorite subject of children&rsquo;s stories. Remember a treasure hunting story you read in your childhood and compare and contrast it with &lsquo;The Treasure in the Forest.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&apos;The Hidden Treasure&apos; is a story that I heard when I was a kid.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the story, There was an old father who had three sons who were all idlers and never helped the father. The father was very sad and worried. He tried his level best to mend the habits but did not succeed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once he became very sick, he called his sons, all of whom reached his room. He asked them to sit down and listen carefully. &quot; My dear sons, I&apos;m weak and ill. There is a lot of money hidden in our fields but I have forgotten where I had buried it. Dig that fresher out after my death.&quot;, he said. The farmer died after two days. The sons dug every inch of the land but could not find anything. They were advised to sow wheat in the field. They had a very good crop. The moral of the story is that hard work gives very good results.</p> <p>Like in the story, &quot;The Treasure in the forest&quot;, this story also depicts the greed of humans for wealth. They would rather let his father die, but won&apos;t let go of the treasure, which is almost similar to Chang hi&apos;s death in our story.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> "

Which particular description reminds you of the mythological example?</b> </p> <p>= Hindu readers will be reminded of the relationship between Krishna and Sudama when reading about the narrator&apos;s connection with Runtu.&nbsp;</p> <p>- Krishna and Sudama were pure friends from their childhood, like the narrator and Runtu in this story.&nbsp;</p> <p>- Runtu is poor like Krishna&apos;s friend Sudhama.&nbsp;</p> <p>- Sudhama, like Runtu, felt ashamed and embarrassed during his visit to Krishna. Runtu has also felt ashamed and timid during his visit to Xun.&nbsp;</p> <p>- Sudhama was warmly welcomed to Krishna&apos;s palace. Similarly, when Runtu visited Xun, Xun greeted him warmly.</p> <p>- Lu Xun helped Runtu in the end by offering a variety of culinary needs, just as Krishna had helped Sudama by transforming his hut into a luxurious home with every comfort.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both of the stories entail that &quot;A friend in need is a true friend&quot;. Wealth status and the economic level cannot hamper the hearty relationship of two intimate friends, if the friendship is not fabricated.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the story support the proposition that the relationships of childhood are innocent, impartial and disinterested?</b> </p> <p>The story supports the proposition that the relationships of childhood are innocent, impartial and disinterested via the example of Runtu&rsquo;s and the narrator&rsquo;s intimate friendship.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;A master/servant relationship existed between Lu Shun and Runtu. &nbsp;Throughout the story, Xun and Runtu&apos;s friendship is shown to be pure, neutral, and disinterested. They interact without regard for master and worker. Their relationship transcends societal boundaries. Their bond is so holy that no socio economic divisions exist. In their adolescence, we see them having fun and freely discussing their thoughts. &nbsp; They are oblivious to the so-called social class inequalities. They are unbiased. They cherish every minute of innocence. We only discover their actual friendship.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like the story, most childhood friendships have similar elements. Childhood is the first phase of life. Everything we do, or do with is the memory for our entire life until we die. The same is with childhood friendships, they are always very pure, innocent and unforgettable. The youngsters always have a close bond.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;After reading the story, what inferences can you make about the contemporary Chinese economic and social system?</b> </p> <p>We learn from &quot;My Old Home&quot; that impoverished smallholders and agricultural labourers had complicated connections.</p> <p>At that time, people from different socioeconomic backgrounds couldn&apos;t connect or create friendship bonds. Runtu is poor while Lu Xun is from a middle class family. Societal rules forbid the two from becoming friends. Slavery and social divides in China are also described from the context of full-time, part-time and year-round servants.</p> <p>Exploitation of peasants and their discontent with feudalism is expressed in the story.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the story indicate about the geographical features of the narrator&rsquo;s hometown?</b> </p> <p>The story indicates many geographical features of the narrator&apos;s hometown. The narrator and his friend Runtu had a great time in their hometown. Back then, there was a lot of beautiful greenery. Watermelons grew on the seashore, making the sand greener. The town used to be peaceful and pleasant.</p> <p><br></p> <p>After twenty years, the narrator returns home and finds no improvement. He finds a gloomy and deserted environment and sees a seaside town abandoned. He feels saddened by the place&apos;s solitude.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Human beings are on the road from time immemorial, always migrating to new places. Write an essay on The Trend of Migration in Nepal in about 300 words.</b> </p> <p><b>The Trend of Migration in Nepal</b></p> <p>The term &quot;migration&quot; refers to cross-border mobility or inter-border mobility of the people for various reasons. People migrate for their own gain and to suit their viewpoints. Nepalese have the trend of both native and international migration.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Nepal, the majority of people move from rural areas to metropolitan areas. Cities are preferred over peaceful and healthy rural places by most people. The majority of Nepalis choose to live in the cities, while the rural areas are often ignored. Youth from the village depart for better opportunities and the education of their children. There is a scarcity of skilled and youthful workers in most communities nowadays. Almost all of the homes in the community are occupied by older people. Migration has resulted in the depopulation of many towns and cities. Many relationships have been ruined because of this inclination.</p> <p>In addition to domestic migration, people are emigrating to other countries. The majority of Nepalese citizens and their families have left the country. Individuals have been disconnected from their family, country, and humanity due to this trend. The shortage of opportunities in Nepal forces many to leave the country and go abroad to earn a better livelihood. This problem has resulted in a nationwide labor shortage. The government should provide a wide range of employment and income opportunities for its citizens.</p> <p><br>In short, Nepal&apos;s migrant population is fast growing. There has to be a reaction from the Nepalese government to properly manage this migration trend.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Find one of your relatives or friends, who has migrated to a new place leaving his/her old home.

      "story": "<p><b>The Half-closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun by Shankar Lamichhane </b></p> <p><br></p> <p>The narrative &apos;The Half-closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun&apos; depicts the sentiments of a Western visitor and a Nepali tourist guide while touring the Kathmandu Valley. The story opens with a Western traveler describing the view of a lush valley in his or her own language. Because she grew up in the plains and by the sea, she appreciates the smell of the mountains and the serenity of this place. The Buddha&apos;s half-closed eyes immediately put her at ease.</p> <p><br></p> <p>&quot;The Easterners have given us the religion and the Puranas,&quot; explains the traveler, &quot;but they&apos;ve also given us brass figures and ivory jewelry, texts on palm leaves, and pictographs on copperplate.&quot; She is well-versed in Nepali history, having studied dozens of books on the subject. She cites the country&apos;s ethnic and religious variety as evidence that the soil of Nepal has allowed them to thrive in harmony. She also discusses many types of cuisine, such as mo:mo: and so on.</p> <p><br></p> <p>She recalls an elderly lady telling her grandson the legend of Brikuti while smoking hookah. She is in amazement of the Nepalese people&apos;s warm smiles as they greet visitors. Among the numerous comparisons she makes is to the moment after her successful delivery and being with her father, among other things. Finally, she explains about the amazing eyes and expresses her wish to witness the sunset mirrored in the Buddha&apos;s eyes, memorable eyes.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The guide&apos;s thoughts and emotions are explored in the second half of the novel. He continues with the narrative of Chobhar Hill, the gap carved by Manjushri with a sword to drain the water away from the mountaintop. He uses Adinath as an example of Nepalese tolerance and cohabitation to illustrate his point. A residence where she can feel the pulse of the actual world awaits her next.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>He wanted to demonstrate to her one of the most powerful creations of his creator. It&apos;s a polio-infected youngster who has lost all movement in his or her body. There are no physical activities that he can engage in at this point in time. He likens the child&apos;s stare to that of a samyak.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The ability to stay silent, passive, impotent, and motionless yet nevertheless surviving without complaint is unique to Easterners, according to him. The guide convinces the child&apos;s parents that she is a doctor in order to get their trust. Since she is their oldest kid, they assume she is come for the brother&apos;s cure. They are overjoyed. In their eyes, there is a tenderness and a sense of thanks. Besides that, he displays the child&apos;s sibling, who has a perfectly functioning body, as well. The activities she is capable of depend on her age. When his mother chastises his sibling, they can see the glint in the child&apos;s eyes. He&apos;s probably trying to make the point that doing things he can&apos;t is a lot of fun. They learn by experience.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To sum it up: The guide says she can&apos;t help but notice how gorgeous Buddha&apos;s eyes are at sunset since they are so welcoming and conceal their own end.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Understanding the text</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the tourist describe his initial impression of the Kathmandu valley?</b> </p> <p>= The tourist describes his initial impression of the Kathmandu Valley by describing the natural sceneries and views of the valley which is decorated with rectangular landscapes and clay-made homes painted in red, yellow, and white. He adds that the air is filled with the scent of old-fashioned smell of soil and serenity of mountains.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;According to the tourist, why is the West indebted to the East?</b> </p> <p>= West is indebted to the East because east has provided various Puranas, brass figures and ivory decorations, palm-leaf manuscripts and copperplate inscriptions, and most importantly, the holy civilization to the west..</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the tourist interpret the gaze of the monks and nuns?</b> </p> <p>=&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>The tourist interprets the gaze of the monks and nuns as to have a holy sight that is able to view everything as it really is, which is free of any impurities, or discriminations.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why do the tourists think Nepali people are wonderful and exceptional?</b> </p> <p>= The tourists believe Nepali people are wonderful and exceptional because of their welcoming smiles, peaceful and co-existent lives, their skillful arts of &nbsp;ornamentations and styles in the wooden pictures, their belief in deities, traditional and unique musics and ornaments etc.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the different kinds of communities in the Kathmandu valley and how do they coexist with each other?</b> </p> <p>= The different kinds of communities in the Kathmandu Valley range from Aryans to the non-Aryans to the Hindus to the Buddhists to all non - hindus. Everyone from all of these races were able to coexist because of the holy land, and their feeling of brotherhood.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the tourist feel about the temple of Adinath?</b> </p> <p>= &nbsp;The tourist feels the temple of Adinath as the bridge stone of religious tolerance and coexistence of two different traditions. Shiva shrine is a hindu temple, but there are numerous Buddha statues and several prayer wheels with &lsquo;Om mani padme hum&rsquo; written on them on the premise of the main temple as well. Childrens from different cultural backgrounds and origins were playing there happily. They are unconcerned with their gods, faiths, and ideologies.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does the guide take the tourist to the remote village?</b> </p> <p>= &nbsp;The guide took the tourist to the remote village because he wanted to show him the eyes of a paralyzed child from a poor family to teach him what life is really like. Tourists only knew the bright and pleasing side of the country but the guide was trying to show him the compassionate side of this beautiful country.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the innocent village couple think of the doctor?</b> </p> <p>= &nbsp;The innocent village couple believes the tourist to be their oldest son, who has come to give the brother a life-restoring medicine from the seven seas. The guide lied to them about the tourist being a doctor, but the tourist was not a doctor.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the differences between the paralyzed child and his sister?</b> </p> <p>= The biggest difference between the paralyzed child and his sister is mobility. There is just one organ that the paralysed kid can move: the eyes but his sister&apos;s body works perfectly. She is able to see, walk, talk, crawl, and take care of herself on her own.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does the guide show the instances of poverty to the tourist?</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> The guide shows the instances of poverty to the tourist because he wanted the tourist to realize the hardships, struggles, obligations and miserable condition of common and poor families in Nepal. Tourist claimed himself to know a lot of Nepal, in fact she did, but she had never felt or known the compassionate side of this beautiful country.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Which narrative technique is used by the author to tell the story? How is this story different from other stories you have read?</b> </p> <p>= To narrate the story of &quot;The Half-closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun,&quot; author Shankar Lamichhane uses the &lsquo;<b>stream of consciousness&apos; technique.</b> It is a storytelling technique that seeks to accurately portray a character&apos;s thoughts.</p> <p>It&apos;s a voice within, but it&apos;s also something more. Stream-of-consciousness storytelling uses free association, repetition, sensory observations, and strange (or nonexistent) punctuation and grammar to let readers understand a character&apos;s mental state and worldview.</p> <p>One of the things I admire about this writing style is how it flows. Not only that, but it&apos;s written in the second person by a foreigner and a guide to Kathmandu Valley. Rather than events, this story uses &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; to depict the characters&apos; ideas.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How is the author able to integrate two fragments of the narration into a unified whole?</b> </p> <p>= The author of the short story &quot;The Half-closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun&quot; aims to weave together two separate narratives by linking them to each other via the use of eyes. The tourist only knows the brighter and happier side of the country but the tourist knows both / miserable side of the nation as well. It&apos;s clear from this passage that the author is talking about what&apos;s going on in his or her town and what people do to make money. Using farmers as an analogy, he points out that farmers are often ignorant of the world around them, because they are busy in their own struggle-full world.</p> <p>As a result, he conveys a message about the need of seeing things from a different perspective in order to grasp the whole scope of the issue. A stream of consciousness storytelling method and the use of his eyes to describe the importance of the sights and activities are used by him to connect the guide&apos;s trip with the tourist&apos;s observation of the object.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The author brings some historical and legendary references in the story. Collect these references and show their significance in the story.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b> The story &quot;The Half-Closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun&quot; blends historical and legendary references in the story. Even the Puranas demonstrate Nepalese pride in their heritage. Brass and ivory sculptures, palm leaf manuscripts, and copperplate inscriptions all show Nepal&apos;s cultural richness.</p> <p> Gautam Buddha&apos;s eyes are illuminated by a beautiful sunset light that depicts Nepal as a land of hope and peace. Bhikshus are said to symbolize the &quot;Samyak Gaze,&quot; which is a perspective of reality that sees all things as they really are.&nbsp; An overflowing Bagmati River indicates that Manjushree&apos;s sword struck Chobhar, which allowed humans to dwell in Nepal&apos;s Kathmandu valley.&nbsp; In terms of Nepalese tolerance and unity, mention of the Adinath temple in the story is the finest example.&nbsp; Historically, Princess Bhrikuti and King Amshuvarma had ties to neighboring countries such as Tibet.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The author talks about the eyes in many places: the eyes of the shaven monks and nuns, eyes in the window and door panels, the eyes of the Himalayas, the eyes of the paralyzed boy, the eyes of the welcoming villagers and above all the half-closed eyes of the Buddha. Explain how all the instances of eyes contribute to the overall unity of the story.</b> </p> <p>= Eyes are mentioned in a variety of ways, including: the shaven monks and nuns, the Himalayas, the paralyzed boy&apos;s eyes, the welcoming villagers&apos; eyes, and finally the Buddha&apos;s half-closed eyes. Eyes capture the memories and everyone&rsquo;s eyes or simply perspective differs from one another. Everybody has different views and different experiences. All in all, everyone&rsquo;s eyes are safeguarded by the Lord Buddha&apos;s half-closed eyes, as implied by these many instances of eyes. Thus, these people&apos;s eyes reveal a new culture, religion, natural beauty, and the land of Buddha even if all history books were burned today. The journey of a tourist becomes more meaningful because of the memories that are formed via the eyes.</p> <p>In short, Nepal is complete because of the existence of such varying eyes, because each eye has seen different things, memories and perspectives.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay on Living Proximity to Nature.</b> </p> <p><b>&nbsp;Living Proximity (nearer) to Nature : An Essay</b></p> <p>Nature is essential to our well-being in several ways. Nature includes air, water, animals, sunshine, and the moon. Nature is crucial to the growth and preservation of life on Earth. The natural environment provides food and shelter for a wide variety of creatures.</p> <p><br>Nature provides everything from food and water to oxygen and medicine to shelter and clothing for humans. Nature has created all we see around us. The planet&apos;s attractiveness is enhanced by its range of color. All kinds of organisms, both living and nonliving, live in nature.

In your view, how have the Nepali people been able to live in such harmony?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Many ethnic and religious groups in Nepal have coexisted peacefully for a long time, according to the story &quot;The Half-closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun.&quot; This is for a variety of reasons, the most significant of which are historical, cultural, political, and geographical. Individuals of different ethnic and religious origins, in my view, have been able to cohabit peacefully in Nepal because they all adore the same deities. People from different origins all over the world have settled in Nepal, bringing their religious traditions and practices with them. People were more receptive to embracing the gods and practices of other civilizations since the constitution also proclaimed the country to be secular, granting religious freedom to the people.</p> <p>"

      "story": "<b>A Very Old man with enormous Wings</b> <p><br></p> <p>Pelayo encounters a homeless, frightened elderly man with enormous wings in his yard one day while hunting crabs in a rainfall that had lasted for days. The elderly guy is unclean and feeble, and he speaks a language that is difficult to understand. In the end, Pelayo and Elisenda assume that the elderly man was an angel who had attempted to save their ill kid by attempting to take him or her to paradise. Pelayo&apos;s next-door neighbour urges him to kill the angel with a wood, but once their kid heals, he and Elisenda forgive their visitor.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Having the elderly guy living in their chicken coop attracts a lot of attention from interested onlookers. Priest Father Gonzaga, a local priest, informs the villagers that the elderly guy, who seems to be untidy and does not speak Latin, probably isn&apos;t an angel. As a result, Father Gonzaga decides to seek the advice of his bishop.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Despite Father Gonzaga&apos;s best attempts, the old man&apos;s presence quickly spreads, and pilgrims from all over flock to seek his wisdom and treatment. A lady who had been counting her heartbeats since she was a child came because she couldn&apos;t keep up. An introvert arrives because he complains that the stars in the night sky are too loud. &apos;&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Elisenda has to start charging entry since the gathering becomes so huge and noisy. Even when they pluck his feathers and toss stones at him in an attempt to get him to get up, the elderly guy mostly ignores the onlookers&apos; complaints and moans. However, when the visitors use a branding iron to test whether he&apos;s still alive, he becomes enraged.</p> <p><br></p> <p>While he awaits the Church&apos;s judgement on the elderly man, Father Gonzaga tries his best to keep the crowd in control. When a travelling clown show comes into town, the audience begins to depart. People go to hear the legend of the &quot;spider lady,&quot; a woman who, after disobeying her parents, was converted into a big spider with a human head. People rapidly forget the elderly guy, who had only done a few worthless semimiracles for his visitors, because of the popularity of the spider woman&apos;s tragic story.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Despite this, the admittance fees Elisenda levied have made Pelayo and Elisenda very rich. Pelayo resigns from his work and begins construction on a new, bigger home. As the child becomes older, the elderly guy continues to live with them in the chicken coop. Eventually, the chicken coop falls, and the old guy moves into the next shed, although he often wanders about the house, irritating Elisenda.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Just when Pelayo and Elisenda had come to believe that the elderly man would soon pass away, he starts to recover. At night, he sings sea chanteys (songs sung by sailors) to himself. Elisenda stares in wonder as the elderly guy spreads his wings and soars away into the sky.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the narrator describe the weather and its effects in the exposition of the story?</b> </p> <p>It had been raining for three days as the story opens, and Pelayo was throwing crabs from his home into the ocean. His house was nearer the ocean and their child was having a high fever, he thought that was because of the smell of crabs.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Describe the strange old man as Palayo and his wife first encounter within their courtyard.</b> </p> <p>The strange man was clothed in the manner of a ragpicker. His bald head was almost completely shaved, and his mouth was almost empty with sans teeth. His enormous buzzard wings, filthy and half-plucked, were constantly twisted in the muck.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did Pelayo and Elisenda imprison the old man in the chicken coop?</b> </p> <p>Pelayo and Elisenda imprisoned the old man in the chicken coop because they wanted to protect their child who was in danger by the arrival of the old man. It was a neighbor woman who told the couple about the elderly man&apos;s identity that angels were escaping a spiritual conspiracy and coming to the earth to take childs.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why was Father Gonzaga not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger?</b> </p> <p>Father Gonzaga, the local priest, was not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger due to his ragged appearance and his lack of knowledge of Latin. He believed that the Latin language was the language that divine figures speak, and in order for him to be an angel, he must understand and speak latin.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Many people gathered at Pelayo&apos;s house to see the strange old man. Why do you think the crowd assembled to see him?</b> </p> <p>Many people gathered at Pelayo&apos;s house to see the strange old man because the larger wings behind the elderly guy gave him an odd appearance like a unique creature. They were curious to know his identity, where some believed he was God&apos;s prophet, while others just liked to tease him.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Some miracles happened while the crowd gathered to see the strange man. What are these miracles?</b> </p> <p>There were some miracles, such as the blind guy who did not regain his sight but did grow three new teeth, the paralyzed man who did not regain his ability to walk but came very close to winning the lottery, and the leper whose wounds produced sunflowers.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;State the irritating things that the people did with the strange old man.</b> </p> <p>The old man was subjected to insults since he failed to impress anybody. Then they wounded him repeatedly with a branding iron. He was so feeble that he could not react to anything. Then, they pulled his feathers and threw stones at him in order to make him stand. As a result, the old man&apos;s demeanour shifts from passive to abrasive.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How and why was the woman changed into a spider?</b> </p> <p>The woman had changed into a spider because of lightning. She had gone out to a dance without permission, and as she was returning through the forest, a tremendous lightning strike shattered the sky, enabling a bolt of brimstone lightning to hit through the gap, converting her into a spider.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Describe how Elisenda saw the strange man flying over the houses.</b> </p> <p>Elisenda was chopping vegetables in the kitchen when she felt the breeze and walked to the window to check it out. She saw that the elderly guy was attempting to fly. After some attempts, he succeeded to rise, and he vanished as quickly as he came from the sea&apos;s horizon. She breathed a sigh of relief as she observed him.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The arrival of a strange old man at Palayo&rsquo;s courtyard arouses many suspicions and explanations. Explain how the neighbour woman, Father Gonzaga and the doctor speak of the strange man. Why do you think these three people give three different kinds of interpretations?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The neighbour lady, Father Gonzaga, and the doctor all had different kinds of explanations for the old man because of their different ideological backgrounds. Another reason these three people offered three alternative explanations for him could be that the odd old man&apos;s look and actions were so unlike anything else in the real world. He possessed wings and spoke in a language no one could understand, that is why none could agree on just a single theory.</p> <p>When the old man shows up in Pelayo&apos;s courtyard, many questions are raised and theories are offered. According to the neighbour lady who knew everything about life and death, he was an angel sent to take the kid, but he was slain by the rain because he was old. Father Gonzaga, the church priest, suspected the elderly angel since he couldn&apos;t comprehend God&apos;s language. After discovering a whistling sound in his heart and kidneys, the doctor was astonished to find that he had natural wings and questioned why he was the only one who was born with them. Their explanations differed from each other because of the lack of solid knowledge of his identity.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;This story belongs to the genre of &lsquo;magical realism&rsquo;, a genre perfected by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his novels and short stories.

Collect five magic realist happenings from the story and argue why they seem magical to you.</b> </p> <p>Magical realism (Magic + Real) is a storytelling method where the storyteller paints ordinary objects in a fantastic light, making them seem both magical and real. Title itself &quot;A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings&quot; depicts magical realism. A very old man is a real life existence and man with wings is a supernatural figure or a creature from a mythological world. In addition to this, the following instances are a few which make this story more magical to the readers like me;</p> <p> According to the next-door neighbour, the elderly guy is an angel who has arrived to take the ill kid to paradise, here the real object is putting theory associated with a magical object. In this physical reality, things like the lady turning into a spider after being struck by a brimstone lightning bolt, the doctor&apos;s prognosis about the odd old man, the old man&apos;s archaic eyes, and his initial attempt at flight before flying over the final buildings are not normal, but they have happened among the real life environment. It&apos;s magical since people don&apos;t have wings in the real world. But, in the story, having thrown away the crabs, Pelayo returned home and came upon an elderly guy who was laying face down in the mud, his huge wings impeding him. It became clear during Pelayo and his wife&apos;s conversation that the odd old guy was from another planet when the elderly man replied in an unknown tongue in an authoritative seafarer&apos;s voice. It&apos;s interesting and miraculous how well the people were able to capture the elderly guy and also the description of Father Gonzaga. Father Gonzaga compared the odd elderly guy to be an imposter and issued a dire warning to the community about his whereabouts. </p> <p>Because of this, as with many of Gabriel Garcia Marquez&apos;s works, this story also falls under the umbrella of &apos;magical realism.&apos;&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The author introduces the episode of a woman who became a spider for having disobeyed her parents. This episode at once shifts people&rsquo;s concentration from the strange old man to the spider woman. What do you think is the purpose of the author to bring this shift in the story?</b> </p> <p>The author&apos;s aim in making this modification to the plot is to show how oblivious humanity is to beauty and compassion. People&apos;s attention is immediately drawn to the spider lady in this episode, rather than the weird old man.&nbsp;</p> <p>The change in people&apos;s interests suggests they prefer lighter activities over more serious ones. The crowd embraced a lady who defied her parents and became a spider. People in the vicinity seem to have completely forgotten about the appearance of the old angel. People believe she&apos;s a lot less expensive than the shy angel, and she&apos;s also a lot more entertaining for the audience.&nbsp;</p> <p>The author also reveals how two seemingly unrelated occurrences may be linked together in a miraculous way. The story of a lady who turned into a spider after disobeying her parents is introduced by the author.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The story deals with the common people&rsquo;s gullibility. How do Palayo and his wife take advantage of common people&rsquo;s whim?</b> </p> <p>As the story progresses, we see the gullibility, ignorance and stupidity of the general populace. Instead of letting people freely see him, Elisenda thinks of charging people for 5 cents, and Elisenda and her husband make a lot of money. Pelayo and his wife generate money by selling the services of an old guy. The courtyard becomes a market as news spreads about the angel.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;An irresistible crowd queues at Palayo&rsquo;s house for many days simply to look at the strange old man. Narrate an episode from your experience or from another story where people assemble in crowds, not for any noble cause.</b> </p> <p>An irresistible crowd queues at Palayo&rsquo;s house for many days simply to look at the strange old man. In our town, similar incidents frequently take place, when a person gets injured in accidents. People, leaving their own business, start gathering and making a crowd just to see the accident, though there is no noble cause.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The taste of children is different from grown-ups. What are the elements in the story that make &lsquo;The Old Man with Enormous Wings&rsquo; a children&rsquo;s story?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&apos;The Old Man with Enormous Wings&apos; is a children&apos;s story because of various factors. Children love stories specially from the magical and fantasy genre. The stories which are majorly targeted to that age group are usually written in simpler language.</p> <p>The elderly man with wings, the lady who transforms into a spider, the trust in angels, etc. are the magical yet interesting characters in the story. Simple language structure and techniques like symbols are used throughout the story. The story takes place in a wet, muddy area with chicken coops, the sea, forests, and a yard, among other things which make the setting of the story more visualizable to the children.&nbsp;</p> <p>Disputes or scuffle occurs among the many characters, including the elderly neighbour lady, Father Gonzaga, the doctor, and so on, which keep making twists in the story. The elderly guy is shown as an angel with surprising wings who seems to be neither completely human nor fully surreal in appearance. Even though he comes to rescue mankind, the elderly guy symbolises a Christ figure who is rejected and disgraced by them. Several of the five senses may be found in the story, such as the old man&apos;s sight of people, his body&apos;s filthy scent, and the emotions of the various characters and crowd. Wings in the story are also a symbol. Strength, quickness, and freedom of movement are all represented by wings. Angels are often depicted as lovely winged creatures in Christian art. The spider girl is a symbol for the erratic faith of many self-serving persons. The scenario gets amusing as people congregate in the yard to watch the elderly guy and even pay a 5 cent entrance charge to view the angel.</p> <p>All the above factors make this story an engaging and interesting story for the children.</p> <p><br></p>"

      "story": " <b> Summary</b> <h3>Major Symbols Used in the poem</h3> <p>Day = Life</p> <p>Sunrise = Birth</p> <p>Sunset = Death</p> <div> <div> <div></div> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <h2>Brief Summary of the poem</h2> <p>In the &quot;A Day&quot; poem, Dickinson, through the use of brilliant imagery and symbols, describes a beautiful day that leads children from innocence to experience. This describes the rising of the sun, what happens after it rises, and what happens after the sun sets. A thin ribbon of light descends from above the steeple, altering its hue from blue to purple. Upon hearing of the sun rising, the news spreads or the light rays travel like the squirrels running to get away.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sunlight reveals the black hills and a bobolink, a tiny American bird, sings in the lovely morning. When the sun shines, it makes everything and everyone happy and comfortable. In order to ensure that the sun will rise with lovely and wonderful rays, the speaker speaks to himself. Sunrise is confirmed by magnificent scenery, pristine hills, and the singing of the bobolink.&nbsp;</p> <p>The speaker lacks confidence in his description of the sunset. When the sun goes down, the sky begins to purr, and it continues to purr until the sky is totally black. There is a golden tint to the boys and girls as they return to their refuge. The grey-suited caretaker/father waits for the children to return. He opens the gate and allows the youngsters in, allowing additional flocks to enter their home.</p> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div><br></div> <h2>What is the main theme of A Day poem?</h2> <div>A day poem deals with the theme of birth and death. Here, the rising sun symbolises birth and the sunset symbolises death. As soon as a child is born, he/she grows up very fast and gradually starts to understand various responsibilities, just like we get busy during the day. So, one can say that the most important theme of the poem is the journey of life from birth to death. Death and immortality are the main themes that are thoroughly discussed in this poem.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <h2>Literary devices used in the poem&nbsp;</h2> <p>Literary devices like Alliteration/Symbol/Metaphor/Simile/Personification are also used in this poem. Let&apos;s discuss about them thoroughly.</p> <div> <div>Symbolism: The poem as a whole represents the passage from life to death. The poet infers human behaviours connected with life and death with each verse.&nbsp;</div> <div><br></div> <div>Metaphor: She employs a number of clear analogies to create sympathetic images. She refers to sunrays as &quot;ribbons&quot; in verse I, line 2. In verse 3, line 3, she refers to the same sunrays as &quot;Yellow lads and girls.&quot; In verse 4, line 2, the &quot;Dominie in grey&quot; represents &quot;God&quot; or a religious person, while &quot;flock&quot; alludes to people. Finally, in stanza 4, line 3, &quot;evening bars&quot; is a metaphor for the conclusion of a day or the end of life.&nbsp;</div> <div>Simile: In verse 1, line 4, the &quot;news&quot; of dawn spreads with the pace of a squirrel&apos;s run, which is an example of simile.&nbsp;</div> <div><br></div> <div>Personification: In &quot;A Day,&quot; another poetic technique is personification. It occurs in verse I, line 3, where &quot;Steeples,&quot; like humans, swim; and in stanza 2, line 2, where &quot;hills,&quot; like ladies, remove their &quot;bonnets.&quot;&nbsp;</div> <div><br></div> <div>Alliteration&nbsp;occurs in stanza I, line 3, with the repeat of the &quot;s&quot; sound; it also appears in stanza 2, line 2, with the predominant &quot;b&quot; sound.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> </div> <h2>Stanza by Stanza Explanation of the poem</h2> <div> <div><br></div> <div>According to the poet, she observes how the Sun rises in the first verse, as well as the changing conditions that follow from the Sun&apos;s rising. She compared the rays of the sun with one ribbon at a time. She likens the beams of the sun to the ribbon, and says, &quot;the rays of the sun are like the ribbon.&quot; The poet wrote the ribbon. When one speaks to a rise, however, it applies in this instance. In this case, the metaphor is in use.</div> <div><br></div> <div>When she observed that the sunlight was scattered over the sky, she concluded that the rays looked like ribbons. The church&apos;s spire took on a deeper shade of violet as a result of the sunlight striking it. Tall structures that are often seen in churches are known as steeples. It had the colour of amethyst and seemed to be made of it. A purple coloured gemstone that is extremely valuable is known as amethyst. When the squirrels run, it doesn&apos;t take long for the news to spread that the sun has risen. With the sunrise, the hills were revealed as if they had removed their bonnets. A songbird from the United States known as the &quot;bubbling.&quot;The duo started singing their morning hymn, as they got dressed. In the poet&apos;s view, the sun was behind all that had occurred. Although this good feeling was brought about by the sun, in the end, it was the sun that caused it.</div> <div><br></div> <div>Then, of course, there is the beauty of nature. This beautiful image represents the concept that everything moves at breakneck speed when the sun rises. Because we have to rush from the moment we get up, this symbolises how fast-paced our life is. The wonder of the rising sun is brought to life by the sun. And this serves as a representation of the starting point of anything.</div> <div><br></div> <div>We don&apos;t know how she created the scenario in the third stanza. At this time, there were many little yellow boys and girls ascending toward the other side or dominating in grey. Her use of the phrase &quot;how the sun sets&quot; in these lines clarifies her no-idea about how the sun sets. At dusk, the skies become a lighter shade of red, as do the faces of the children who are playing outside. When this happens, a Dominion moves in to gather up the children and take them back to their houses.</div> <div><br></div> <div>At sunset, the clouds in the western sky have a broad spectrum of orange, yellow, and purple hues, and they seem to be in motion. The poet recalls how children often go up and down stairs while they play. These kids are then taken away by a Domini at night&apos;s end. The word &quot;domini,&quot; which means &quot;teachers,&quot; is derived from &quot;dominus,&quot; which means &quot;lord&quot; in Latin. It is the darkness of the night that signifies the end of the day in a figurative sense.</div> <div><br></div> <div>While some may take the colour grey as meaning that a lovely day has ended, or that the poet does not know when the sun will set, I choose to see it as a symbol of the end of a day, reminding me that the poet does not know when the sun will set. Because nobody knows what happens after death, this is called the Great Unknown. Sunrise is the beginning of life and sunset is the end of life, yet they happen at the same time. This is the most significant part of the poem, and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve learned something new.</div> </div> <h3><br></h3> <h2>Conclusion of the Poem</h2> <div> <div>The poem starts with the speaker explaining how the sun rises and what happens thereafter in a nice manner. The first and second lines of the poem depict the speaker&apos;s delight at witnessing steeples change colour after sunrise, birds, hills, and the rising sun itself. She explains the items in such a way that they reflect the innocence of a kid in terms of how he or she views the universe.</div> <div><br></div> <div> <div>The speaker discusses the sun setting in the poem&apos;s third and fourth stanzas. She said that she had no idea how it worked. She is unable to provide an explanation due to a lack of information. This represents the immobility that comes with death. It also demonstrates how little people really know about dying. Despite this, the speaker claims that the sky becomes purple when the sun goes down, and it&apos;s totally black when the light comes up. The youngsters, according to the speaker, climbed up the stile/ladder to cross it, and when they got to the other side, their instructor put up the nighttime bar and led them away.</div> <div><br></div> <div>Dickinson discusses a wonderful day that brings children from innocence to experience in her poem &quot;A Day&quot; through the use of bright imagery and metaphors. Emily Dickinson&apos;s &apos;A Day&apos; is a well-known nineteenth-century metaphysical poem, renowned for its double meanings and cerebral allusions. &apos;A Day&apos; is a literal term that refers to sunrise and sunset. It also describes, in a figurative sense, the passage from life to death. Additionally, the poem has a kid narrator whose innocent and certain tone evokes the splendour of daybreak.</div> </div> </div>  <p><b>Exercise Questions Answers of A day Poem by Emily Dickinson Class 12 English</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Understanding the text</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the poet describe the morning sun in the first stanza?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The poet describes the morning sun as a sign of happiness in the first stanza. The sun&apos;s beams resembled a series of loosely knotted ribbons. In a flash, everything became crystal clear. The steeple of the church took on an amethyst hue as a result. Then, the news of the sun&apos;s arrival travels as quickly as a squirrel&apos;s quick movements.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the line &lsquo;The news like squirrels ran&rsquo; mean?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The meaning of the line &apos;The news like squirrels ran&apos; is that the pace of spread of the news of sunrise was so quick, as is the squirrels speed. Squirrels are faster-running creatures. The light of the sun spreads rapidly. That is why, the poet used the metaphor of &apos;The news like squirrels ran&apos; to indicate that the news of sunrise was faster like the speed of squirrels.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do you understand by the line &lsquo;The hills untied their bonnets&rsquo;?</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> The hills are in the cap (bonnet) of darkness before the sun rises. Bonnets mean a special type of hat which can be tied under the chin. Before sunrise, the hills seemed darker and gloomier as they were not happy. But as soon as the sun emerges and the sun rays fall on hills, they become so happy and excited. They unveil their greenery and beauty by removing their bonnets. All hills appear lovely in excellent green colour after sunrise. The hills are characterised as they loosen their caps like ladies. Hence, the hills seem to be removing their hats in a frenzied manner, after the sunrise is what the above phrase means.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Is the speaker watching the morning sun? Why? Why not?</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> No, the speaker is not watching the morning sun because&nbsp;he is not doing the real-time narration of the morning sun. &apos;I&rsquo;ll tell you how the Sun rose&rsquo; means that the speaker has witnessed the sun rise and the changes following the sun rise, and at the present moment he is describing what he saw to his friends who woke up later in the morning.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the sun set?</b> </p> <p>The speaker is really unknown to the sunset. All he knows is that the sun goes away taking all the happiness, joy and leaves the unhappy and gloomy dark when it sets, he doesn&apos;t know where. The slowly turning purple and yellow hues signal the sun&apos;s setting, but since he is unclear, he doesn&apos;t know how exactly the sun set.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What, according to the speaker, is a day?</b> </p> <p>= Emily Dickinson&apos;s &apos;A Day&apos; is a lyrical poem that describes dawn and sunset, where day is symbolised as life. A day is life, where sun rise is the birth, and setting of the sun is compared with death. &nbsp;It also depicts the beauty of life and the uncertainty of death in a philosophical sense. Sunrise and sunset are literally described in &apos;A Day.&apos; It further describes the journey from life to death in a metaphorical way.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What purpose does the hyphen in the first line serve in the poem?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Hyphen(--) is used in poetry to indicate a break. In this poem, Emily Dickenson innovatively utilizes this punctuation mark. She is using hyphens if she does not find the words for profound feelings, to give readers the power of silence in some circumstances, to imagine, to fill the missing word, or she is allowing the readers to take some time to ponder on the context by themselves.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What makes this poem lyrical and sonorous? Discuss.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>It is a lyrical poem in the sense that it communicates the author&apos;s own thoughts and feelings.. In lyrical poetry, the use of the first-person pronoun &quot;I&quot; denotes the poet&apos;s identity. In this poem, the author expresses her own personal experience of waking up to the first rays of sunlight. Sonorous is a style of writing that is rich in sound and crammed with rhymes or phrases. The musical and melodic quality of a poem is influenced by a wide range of circumstances. Sound methods including alliteration, assonance, rhyme, and rhythm are used in this poem to improve its musicality.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Who is the target audience of the speaker? Why?</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> In this poem, Children and Adults both are the target audience of the speaker. The readers are shown the world as viewed by an innocent kid. Speaker is telling his friends, &quot;I will tell you how the sun rose&quot;. So, We may argue that the intended audience consists of kids who have lost the opportunity to see the sun rising when they wake up late in the morning.&nbsp;</p> <p>When we look at the poem from a philosophical point of view, the whole human race is also the intended audience. Sunrise is the beginning of life, daytime activities are a trip through life, and sundown is the end of life. However, the final result is a little mysterious.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The poem seems to describe a day for children. How would the adult people respond to this poem? Discuss this poem with your parents/guardians and write the answer based on their responses.</b> </p> <p>= The poem seems to describe a day for children. But, this poem is also suitable for adult people. This poem is a literal description of the dawn, as well as the events that occur between sunrise and sundown. For children, the direct meaning of the poem is applicable but for adults, the metaphysical meaning of this poem makes more sense. To be more precise, the poem speaks about the passage from life to death in a metaphysical sense. There is enthusiasm at the beginning of life, a squirrel racing like a life and a strange conclusion to a life in this poem.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>&nbsp;Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Observe your surroundings one fine morning and write a poem based on your own experience.</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> You can write a Poem on your own. I am not good at writing poems. Here is just a small verse anyways.</p> <p><b><i>As the night draws to a close,</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Red-orange light begins to emancipate itself...</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Purple and blue with a reddish orange hue.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Amazing beauty is revealed...</i></b></p> <p><b><i>It&apos;s as though the earth has been struck by gold ribbons.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>This is a beautiful scene with a ray of hope in...</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Let&apos;s forget about last night.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>We begin each new day with an amazing sight.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Heart is enjoying for a day start like this,</i></b></p> <p><b><i>The trip begins with a fresh desire and wish,</i></b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write a personal essay on A Day in the School.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> Our lives are filled with numerous experiences, yet we don&apos;t recall them all. No day could be more important and precious to me than the first day in school. I started school when I was six years old. I believe it was April. I was a little child back then.&nbsp;</p> <p>My recollection of my first day of school is still vivid. My school is called &quot;Child Academy&quot;. My instructor escorted me to my classroom after my mother dropped me there. Even though I was nervous entering the classroom, the instructor was very courteous to me. My spot on the front bench was secured in an instant thanks to her. They ran up and shook my hand immediately away, at least three of them. My fears had been allayed. I grabbed a copy of a math textbook and started doing the sums after a few minutes of digging around. After the lesson, a few more students came up to me and introduced themselves. It was a joy to make friends at school. The school day came to an end at 1 p.m. My father picked me up and drove me back to my house.</p> <p><br>My life will never be the same again after that day.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Also Read</b>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3680850586740596037/1823576502465333941#\">A Day by Emily Dickinson Summary Class 12 English</a></p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p>Exercise questions answers solution of all questions of Every Morning I Wake Poem written by Dylan Thomas</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Stanza by Stanza Explanation</b></p> <p>In the poem &quot;Every Morning I wake&quot;, the poet says these lines in the first stanza.</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>Every morning when I wake,</i></p> <p><i>Dear Lord, a little prayer I make,</i></p> <p><i>O please do keep Thy loving eye</i></p> <p><i>On all poor creatures born to die</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>From these lines, the speaker is asking God to love him/them forever. He not only prays to god for the protection of own but also for all innocent creatures in the world.</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>And every evening at sun-down</i></p> <p><i>I ask a blessing on the town,</i></p> <p><i>For whether we last the night or no</i></p> <p><i>I&rsquo;m sure it is always touch-and-go.</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>In these lines, the speaker expresses the uncertainty of life and death. He is unsure if the night is the last night of city inhabitants or not, but he always prays the almighty will make everything good and protect them from any possible harm. The speaker prays to God before going to bed, but he doesn&apos;t know whether he&apos;ll see them again in the morning, so he asks for God to bless them. &nbsp;Every night&apos;s benefits from God enable us to see them the next day.</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>We are not wholly bad or good</i></p> <p><i>Who live our lives under Milk Wood,</i></p> <p><i>And Thou, I know, wilt be the first</i></p> <p><i>To see our best side, not our worst.</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>In the process of living our daily lives, we may be nice or terrible, but only God is aware of our best selves. In this way, the speaker kneels before God, pleading for him to preserve them alive till morning. In Particular, the speaker represents Milk wood town and makes sure that they are not totally bad or totally good. People might judge them in their own way; it all depends on someone&apos;s perspective on how s/he judges others. But the speaker seems optimistic that the god knows the best side of the inhabitants of milk town.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>O let us see another day!</i></p> <p><i>Bless us all this night, I pray,</i></p> <p><i>And to the sun we all will bow</i></p> <p><i>And say, good-bye &ndash; but just for now!</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>Last stanza represents the ending lines of their prayers. Speaker prays that the night will be down soon and the delightful sun will re-appear. Night is used as the imagery in this poem. It points to the pains, stress and undelightful days of the inhabitants of the town or the speaker himself. And he hopes for the Almighty&apos;s help in their bad days. Last GoodBye for now, represents the ending of prayer. This time, the speaker says his or her goodbyes, but he or she knows they won&apos;t be permanent.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Understanding the text</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;When does the speaker pray to the Lord?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The speaker prays to the Lord in the morning time and evening time.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the speaker pray for?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The speaker prays for the grace, sympathy and protection from the god to the residents of Milk wood.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Who are the &lsquo;poor creatures&rsquo;? Why does the speaker call them &lsquo;poor creatures&rsquo;?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Poor creatures actually mean all the innocent creatures that are on planet earth. However, in the prayer, the speaker is referring to the residents of Milk wood as poor creatures. They are referred to as &quot;poor animals&quot; by the speaker since they are made up of &quot;bone and flesh&quot; and are destined to die.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does Milk Wood sound like? A type of wood or a place? Why?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>It seems that Milk Wood is a location since there is no article before the word. There is no need for an article in the case of a single proper noun that refers to a single location.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why do the inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun &lsquo;but just for now&rsquo;?</b> </p> <p><b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</b>Milk Wood&apos;s residents make a bow to the setting sun as a way of saying farewell for the time being. They expect the sun to be shining the following morning. They believe that God&apos;s grace and the warmth of the sun will help them survive another day.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Discuss &ldquo;Every Morning When I Wake&rdquo; as a prayer to God.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b> Dylan Thomas &quot;Every Morning When I Wake&quot; is a prayer poem. In a prayer poem, the speaker asks God for blessings and guidance throughout his life and the lives of all human types and animals. &quot;Dear Lord, a small prayer I make/O please do keep Thy loving eye/on all poor creatures born to die,&quot; from these lines we can say the speaker is praying to God. The speaker is pleading with God to maintain his loving gaze on all of creation and to shower blessings on them.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does the speaker make a prayer to God, but not to a king, a billionaire or a scientist?</b> </p> <p>= The speaker makes a prayer to God, but not to a king, a billionaire or a scientist because he knows well that none can be above god. The speaker prays to God because He is the ultimate being, the source of all creation, and the focal point of every religious belief.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>There are three things that he possesses in abundance: his strength, knowledge, and reality. What makes one rich, one famous, and one powerful is all due to God&apos;s grace and blessings. First and foremost, there are no permanent entities like monarchs or billionaires. There is no substitute for God&apos;s protection. God&apos;s existence is sacred; he created and saved us; we adore and rely on him; and he steers us on a straight and narrow path. Even if someone is very powerful, affluent, or intelligent, they cannot compare to God.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>As a result, we turn to him in prayer in order to obtain his mercy and favor. In the end, we&apos;re all made of bone and flesh, no matter who we are or where we come from. So the speaker goes to the deity and prays to him.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the poet highlight the magnificence of God?</b> </p> <p>= The poet highlights God&apos;s magnificence by pointing out that God&apos;s presence is holy; He created and rescued us; we revere and depend on Him; and He directs us on a right path from the moment we are born until we die.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the rhyme scheme of the poem reinforce its message?</b> </p> <p>= The rhyme pattern used throughout the poem is AABB. There&apos;s an organised structure to this poem&apos;s rhymes, due to the usage of AABB rhyme scheme. Most prayer poems follow this rhyme pattern in order to make a genuine appeal to God. Every second line of every verse rhymes with the previous one. Such rhymes have the effect of making a song more enjoyable to listen to.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Does God exist? Give your opinion.</b> </p> <p>= Yes, of course, I am a theist and I believe in God. For those who are seeking God, don&apos;t rush; God is already inside you. In my opinion, as long as you have a happy attitude and continue to do acts of kindness, you may be certain that God will reward you for them.<br>Despite the fact that we can&apos;t see God, we may nevertheless feel his presence in our everyday routines. The presence of God is as certain as the existence of air. We say that something isn&apos;t real because we can&apos;t see, but it doesn&apos;t make any sense. Things that are unusual and unexpected may be evidence of God&apos;s presence. Many sixth-sensors believe in a higher power. Our five senses have accustomed us only to the physical world. No one has yet seen or felt God, hence some argue he doesn&apos;t exist. Still, I have faith in him.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;In his Epistle to the author of the book, The Three Impostors (1768), Voltaire says, &ldquo;Even if God didn&rsquo;t exist, it would be necessary to invent him.&rdquo; Write an essay highlighting the importance of God in the society.</b> </p> <p>= Good individuals build civilized civilizations. That means we must develop an idealized version of God.</p> <p>Most soul-believers also believe in God. A healthy society needs God or He must be manufactured. Those who lived by moral principles rest quietly in God&apos;s presence. Faith in God keeps people believing this. Without God, the world is a mess. We&apos;d have to create God without him. According to 18th century French philosopher Voltaire, true happiness requires faith in a higher power-God. And he is the source of all natural laws. Every culture must believe in Him.</p> <p>Our supreme creator has maintained our life. He instructs us to let go of vengeance, greed, and passion. People&apos;s ideas influence culture. Fear of God drives criminals. God represents everything good in our civilization, while evil represents everything bad. If they don&apos;t repent, they&apos;ll spend eternity in purgatory. We learn to be more kind, caring, loving, and compassionate. People don&apos;t do horrible things for God. Without God, people die, and chaos occurs.</p> <p>"

      "story": "<p><b>Stanza by Stanza Explanation</b></p> <p>In the poem &quot;Every Morning I wake&quot;, the poet says these lines in the first stanza.</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>Every morning when I wake,</i></p> <p><i>Dear Lord, a little prayer I make,</i></p> <p><i>O please do keep Thy loving eye</i></p> <p><i>On all poor creatures born to die</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>From these lines, the speaker is asking God to love him/them forever. He not only prays to god for the protection of own but also for all innocent creatures in the world.</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>And every evening at sun-down</i></p> <p><i>I ask a blessing on the town,</i></p> <p><i>For whether we last the night or no</i></p> <p><i>I&rsquo;m sure it is always touch-and-go.</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>In these lines, the speaker expresses the uncertainty of life and death. He is unsure if the night is the last night of city inhabitants or not, but he always prays the almighty will make everything good and protect them from any possible harm. The speaker prays to God before going to bed, but he doesn&apos;t know whether he&apos;ll see them again in the morning, so he asks for God to bless them. &nbsp;Every night&apos;s benefits from God enable us to see them the next day.</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>We are not wholly bad or good</i></p> <p><i>Who live our lives under Milk Wood,</i></p> <p><i>And Thou, I know, wilt be the first</i></p> <p><i>To see our best side, not our worst.</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>In the process of living our daily lives, we may be nice or terrible, but only God is aware of our best selves. In this way, the speaker kneels before God, pleading for him to preserve them alive till morning. In Particular, the speaker represents Milk wood town and makes sure that they are not totally bad or totally good. People might judge them in their own way; it all depends on someone&apos;s perspective on how s/he judges others. But the speaker seems optimistic that the god knows the best side of the inhabitants of milk town.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><i>O let us see another day!</i></p> <p><i>Bless us all this night, I pray,</i></p> <p><i>And to the sun we all will bow</i></p> <p><i>And say, good-bye &ndash; but just for now!</i></p> <p><br></p> <p>Last stanza represents the ending lines of their prayers. Speaker prays that the night will be down soon and the delightful sun will re-appear. Night is used as the imagery in this poem. It points to the pains, stress and undelightful days of the inhabitants of the town or the speaker himself. And he hopes for the Almighty&apos;s help in their bad days. Last GoodBye for now, represents the ending of prayer. This time, the speaker says his or her goodbyes, but he or she knows they won&apos;t be permanent.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Understanding the text</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;When does the speaker pray to the Lord?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The speaker prays to the Lord in the morning time and evening time.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the speaker pray for?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The speaker prays for the grace, sympathy and protection from the god to the residents of Milk wood.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Who are the &lsquo;poor creatures&rsquo;? Why does the speaker call them &lsquo;poor creatures&rsquo;?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Poor creatures actually mean all the innocent creatures that are on planet earth. However, in the prayer, the speaker is referring to the residents of Milk wood as poor creatures. They are referred to as &quot;poor animals&quot; by the speaker since they are made up of &quot;bone and flesh&quot; and are destined to die.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does Milk Wood sound like? A type of wood or a place? Why?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>It seems that Milk Wood is a location since there is no article before the word. There is no need for an article in the case of a single proper noun that refers to a single location.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why do the inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun &lsquo;but just for now&rsquo;?</b> </p> <p><b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</b>Milk Wood&apos;s residents make a bow to the setting sun as a way of saying farewell for the time being. They expect the sun to be shining the following morning. They believe that God&apos;s grace and the warmth of the sun will help them survive another day.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Discuss &ldquo;Every Morning When I Wake&rdquo; as a prayer to God.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b> Dylan Thomas &quot;Every Morning When I Wake&quot; is a prayer poem. In a prayer poem, the speaker asks God for blessings and guidance throughout his life and the lives of all human types and animals. &quot;Dear Lord, a small prayer I make/O please do keep Thy loving eye/on all poor creatures born to die,&quot; from these lines we can say the speaker is praying to God. The speaker is pleading with God to maintain his loving gaze on all of creation and to shower blessings on them.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does the speaker make a prayer to God, but not to a king, a billionaire or a scientist?</b> </p> <p>= The speaker makes a prayer to God, but not to a king, a billionaire or a scientist because he knows well that none can be above god. The speaker prays to God because He is the ultimate being, the source of all creation, and the focal point of every religious belief.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>There are three things that he possesses in abundance: his strength, knowledge, and reality. What makes one rich, one famous, and one powerful is all due to God&apos;s grace and blessings. First and foremost, there are no permanent entities like monarchs or billionaires. There is no substitute for God&apos;s protection. God&apos;s existence is sacred; he created and saved us; we adore and rely on him; and he steers us on a straight and narrow path. Even if someone is very powerful, affluent, or intelligent, they cannot compare to God.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>As a result, we turn to him in prayer in order to obtain his mercy and favor. In the end, we&apos;re all made of bone and flesh, no matter who we are or where we come from. So the speaker goes to the deity and prays to him.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the poet highlight the magnificence of God?</b> </p> <p>= The poet highlights God&apos;s magnificence by pointing out that God&apos;s presence is holy; He created and rescued us; we revere and depend on Him; and He directs us on a right path from the moment we are born until we die.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the rhyme scheme of the poem reinforce its message?</b> </p> <p>= The rhyme pattern used throughout the poem is AABB. There&apos;s an organised structure to this poem&apos;s rhymes, due to the usage of AABB rhyme scheme. Most prayer poems follow this rhyme pattern in order to make a genuine appeal to God. Every second line of every verse rhymes with the previous one. Such rhymes have the effect of making a song more enjoyable to listen to.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Does God exist? Give your opinion.</b> </p> <p>= Yes, of course, I am a theist and I believe in God. For those who are seeking God, don&apos;t rush; God is already inside you. In my opinion, as long as you have a happy attitude and continue to do acts of kindness, you may be certain that God will reward you for them.<br>Despite the fact that we can&apos;t see God, we may nevertheless feel his presence in our everyday routines. The presence of God is as certain as the existence of air. We say that something isn&apos;t real because we can&apos;t see, but it doesn&apos;t make any sense. Things that are unusual and unexpected may be evidence of God&apos;s presence. Many sixth-sensors believe in a higher power. Our five senses have accustomed us only to the physical world. No one has yet seen or felt God, hence some argue he doesn&apos;t exist. Still, I have faith in him.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;In his Epistle to the author of the book, The Three Impostors (1768), Voltaire says, &ldquo;Even if God didn&rsquo;t exist, it would be necessary to invent him.&rdquo; Write an essay highlighting the importance of God in the society.</b> </p> <p>= Good individuals build civilized civilizations. That means we must develop an idealized version of God.</p> <p>Most soul-believers also believe in God. A healthy society needs God or He must be manufactured. Those who lived by moral principles rest quietly in God&apos;s presence. Faith in God keeps people believing this. Without God, the world is a mess. We&apos;d have to create God without him. According to 18th century French philosopher Voltaire, true happiness requires faith in a higher power-God. And he is the source of all natural laws. Every culture must believe in Him.</p> <p>Our supreme creator has maintained our life. He instructs us to let go of vengeance, greed, and passion. People&apos;s ideas influence culture. Fear of God drives criminals. God represents everything good in our civilization, while evil represents everything bad. If they don&apos;t repent, they&apos;ll spend eternity in purgatory. We learn to be more kind, caring, loving, and compassionate. People don&apos;t do horrible things for God. Without God, people die, and chaos occurs.</p> <p>"

      "story": "<p>Summary of I Was My Own Route by Julia De Burgos Class 12 English Book</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Stanza 1</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>The speaker is a lady who refuses to be what men want her to be. To her, emancipation is a quest for freedom in the location where she is. With her feet on the earth, she walked her own path, without following any set route. It was time to move on.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Stanza 2</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>The speaker describes how she overcame the urgent flapping of ancient trunks, alluding to the women&apos;s conventions. Her back was torn with old logs, she continues, symbolizing the barriers she was prepared to face, no matter how painful.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Stanza 3</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>The speaker claims she escaped the tree trunks that entrapped her and the castrating horizon. The new routes&apos; kiss started to feel intimately liberating. It is a new equilibrium in her life.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Stanza 4</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>Now the speaker knows who she is, what she stands for, and where she wants to go. She sees herself as ground flowers. Her history began with lands without a future and soils without limits, imposed by man. She tore that ground to plant her own roots, conquering hurdles and charting her own path.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Stanza 5</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>&quot;And I was all in me as life was in me...&quot; indicates the speaker&apos;s strength from choosing her own future. It was time to meet her actual self. She is now completely free.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Stanza 6</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>&ldquo;I wanted to be as guys wanted me to be: an effort at existence; a game of hide-and-seek with myself,&rdquo; the speaker continues. But I am now;&apos;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Her life was veiled to herself. She overcomes a life of false futures by knowing her present. She twisted her urge to follow these guys and departed without expecting any acknowledgement.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS.&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did the speaker try to be the way men wanted her to be?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The speaker tried to be the way men wanted her to be because she was living in a society where females were anticipated to be like what men want them to be like with their dominant male idea.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do you understand by her feet &apos;would not accept walking backwards&apos;?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&lsquo;Her feet would not accept walking backwards&apos; means that she had no intention of walking after males. She wanted women on an equal footing with males in the race, with the ultimate goal of liberation. She was unwilling to accept the male-dominated view that women were less valuable than men.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Who are the old guards? Why did they grow desperate?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The old guard are those conservative minded people of society who are highly influenced and supportive to male supremacy ideals. Julia was making progress toward improving the lives of the impoverished women and fighting for their liberation, that&apos;s why they became fearful and grew desperate.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did the speaker have &lsquo;a feeling of intimate liberation&apos;?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The speaker had a feeling of intimate liberation because she was on the new path where she transcended the barrier of patriarchal society and rejected the old one set by males.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did the desire to follow men warp in her?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The desire to follow men warped in her because of her wish for freedom and enjoyment in patriarchal society. Yet she is compelled to adhere to men&apos;s established ideals and beliefs.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the text&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the speaker mean when she says she was playing a game of hide and seek with her being&apos;?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>When the speaker says that she was playing a game of hide and seek with herself, she is expressing that her identity was only a game to be performed under patriarchal ideology. She was completely unknown on what she was, what she had to do and how she should behave. However, she is now expressing her lot of anger and criticism of patriarchal concepts that confine women to four walls. She wants to be free of gender stereotypes and pursue her own goals.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why, in your view, was her back ripped by the old guards as she was advancing forward?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Her back was ripped out by the old guard because old guards believed in the patriarchal system a lot and they did not want any women to go beyond their rules. But in order to achieve true independence, she must overcome oppression and race-based discrimination. As a result of the social constraints imposed by the society&apos;s old guard, she suffers a great deal and has her back ripped by old guards with norms, rules and traditions as threat.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What, according to the speaker, did it feel like to be free?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The speaker says that being free is like flying like a bird without any societal or gender limitations. For her, being free is the same as choosing her own route and doing her own thing. It means to walk and feel like a man in society, and to obtain long-awaited emancipation.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does the speaker prefer the present to the past?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The speaker prefers the present over the past since her past was bad. Her history was a mess. Patriarchy caused her a lot of pain. The patriarchal restrictions hampered her. She was considered as a toy to be played and a joke to be laughed at. She was unaware of her heart&apos;s independence. Her desires were restricted. She was abused and starved by family and society. Currently, she is free of masculine notions and freed. Male ideology and fear is slowly fading out. Female freedom is beginning to take hold, and male dominance is disappearing. Her acts and decisions are her own. She can work and go anywhere. So, she prefers the present over the past.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;John Donne, in his poem &ldquo;No Man is an Island&apos;&apos;, says, &ldquo;No man is an island entire of itself.&rdquo; Would Burgos agree with Donne? Do you agree with Donne or Burgos?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>When John Donne wrote the poem &quot;No Man Is an Island,&quot; he said that &quot;No Man Is an Island Entire by Himself.&quot; He&apos;s referring to the whole human species as a whole, and their role in shaping society as a whole. Because no one is fully self-sufficient, everyone must depend on the support and companionship of others to flourish. Keeping society equal in the name of rights, freedom, fairness, choices, chances, and many more is a position that I wholeheartedly endorse. To flourish, people need to be a part of a larger group, and the expression &quot;no man is an island&quot; reflects this notion. &nbsp;</p> <p>I support John Donne for the notion of providing equal opportunities to both men and women and their co-existence. But, Julia De Bergos, completely dismisses the importance of male roles in societies.Her words, in reality, is nothing more than an outlet for her resentment towards males. The man and woman are two wheels on a cart. It is impossible for the cart to go ahead if one of its wheels has been broken.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>REFERENCE BEYOND THE TEXT&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay on My Idea of Freedom.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>My Idea of Freedom : an essay&nbsp;</b></p> <p>The capacity to act or adjust one&apos;s behavior without hindrance is often referred to as &quot;freedom.&quot; According to the eminent physicist Albert Einstein: &quot;Freedom in any event, is only conceivable through struggle. I think of freedom as the ability to do what you want without interference from anybody else. And it&apos;s also a mindset in which one has complete freedom to do anything they want, whenever they want.&nbsp;</p> <p>Depending on who you ask, freedom means various things to different people. For me, freedom is the power to make one&apos;s own decisions. It is a fundamental human right that must exist from the birth of humans. Neither can it be seen, felt or accessed by the senses of touch, sight, hearing or taste, but it must exist. There are different ways in which freedom may be utilized, and it is not a universal term.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To sum up, freedom is the ability to do whatever one wants with one&apos;s life, live wherever one wants, eat whatever one wants, and study whatever one wants as long as one has the means to do so. A wide range of definitions of freedom are used to describe it, including political, social, personal and religious freedom. However, the universal need for freedom is true in all circumstances.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Not all people, however, seem to agree with the kind of freedom upheld by Burgos in this poem. For example, William Faulkner, in his novel Requiem for a Nun, says, &ldquo;The past is never dead. It&apos;s not even past. All of us labor in webs spun long before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and consequence, of history and eternity.&quot; Do you agree with Faulkner? Why? Why not?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Not everyone will like Burgos&apos; poetry &quot;I Was My Own Route.&quot; &nbsp;William Faulkner, in his novel Requiem for a Nun, says, &ldquo;The past is never dead. It&apos;s not even past. All of us labor in webs spun long before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and consequence, of history and eternity.&nbsp;</p> <p>When is the best time to ask this question? As soon as you say anything, it&apos;s gone, leaving behind a memory. As a result, we live in the past at all times, creating memories and doing actions. Since time goes on, the past will always exist. Thoughts of the past are living things. Everything we do and witness is recorded in history. Whatever happens, it becomes part of our memory, but memories remain forever. That we&apos;re always in the past.&nbsp;</p> <p>Julia Burgos&apos; poem expresses a desire to forget her past. She wishes to get rid of her difficult past because it has haunted her for so long. It is, however, impossible to do so. The freedom that Julia de Bures fights for completely disproves the notion that there was a past too. She wants to transcend the presence of men in order to create her identity by denying the past and disapproving the existence of men. However, the world will come to a halt if men are avoided. The fact that she&apos;s a radical feminist means that she&apos;s outraged by the way men dominate women. For the sake of humanity&apos;s survival, it is critical that both sexes be present.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Our past shapes our present and future according to William. His viewpoint is practical. We can&apos;t ignore it. I agree with him after reading these writers. &nbsp;</p> <p>"

The poet sees the African people as they go through a variety of difficulties in life. Because of this, he advocates for a world of peace, wealth, happiness, emancipation, and oneness. He aspires to awaken the whole world and its inhabitants to the &ldquo;awakening age&rdquo; of enlightenment from a world of darkness and poverty.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why, in your view, have these people &lsquo;lived with poverty&apos;s rage&apos;?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>In my view, these people have lived with poverty&apos;s rage because they are tortured, suppressed and provided many hardships to accomplish for living in the community. They express such a rage to do much suppression over them.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does the poet appeal for solidarity among the people?</b> </p> <p>The reason for the poet&apos;s appeal for solidarity is to bring equality, freedom and sentiments of fraternity, justice, togetherness and harmony among people. Liberation and liberty for the people are impossible without a single, united warriors. So, a call for unity is made by the poet, because he hopes that the people would band together to overcome their trials, hurdles, and pain.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Does the poet present migration in a positive light?

Have you noticed any change in the perceptions and behaviours of these migrants when they return home from abroad?</b> </p> <p>Nepal&apos;s economic and educational migrants are well-known. It&apos;s true that these migrants&apos; attitudes and behaviour alter when they return from a foreign country. They&apos;ve got money and a little bit of know-how. &nbsp;Like the migrants like Sanduk Ruit who have returned from India after gaining the speciality in eye operation, we&apos;ve seen a variety of shifts in people&apos;s behaviour and business practises.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Relate the rhyme scheme of this sonnet to the kind of life idealised by the poet.</b> </p> <p>Each line or stanza ends with a rhyme scheme that repeats the same sound pattern ie. AABB CCDD EEFE GG. Every line rhymes, and the couplet is a monorhyme: The poem&apos;s speed and lyrical tone are aided by music.

      "story": "<p><b>Meaning&nbsp;</b>: Soft Storm: Non-Violent Revolt&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Summary</b></p> <p>This poem portrays the speaker as a social freedom fighter. Poem says the condition when the speaker becomes a soft storm. Storm means revolution. And soft means non-violent revolt.</p> <p><br></p> <p>He dislikes the society&apos;s stupid and harsh practices. This poem is a subtle criticism on Nepali society&apos;s problems.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the opening verse, the poet employs terms like uproar, spooky, quiet, sky like crocuses, stones, skidding moon, shredding ceiling to convey Nepali social chaos. Similarly, he links natural diseases to human social behaviours using terminology like politics, postures, rituals, and justifications.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the final line of the first verse, the poet alludes to the problem-free or united metropolis of old. It&apos;s only a memory of a period when society had less social issues.</p> <p><br></p> <p>He mentions destitute youngsters wailing in Thamel in the second verse. They are also screaming for food beneath Kesharmahal&apos;s bat-bearing trees. The lines represent the grim realities of a growing nation. It is a severe national social issue that must be addressed. In the same poem, he refers to the previous un-flourished social incidents as &quot;<b>unwedded gardens of history</b>,&quot; which signifies &quot;lawless, disordered, and anarchy&quot; generated by social and political dominance in Nepalese society.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the third stanza, he describes a lonely youngster sobbing for his mother while wearing a transistor radio. This term describes the plight of street kids. A guy was also thrashed violently for no cause. Similar to this poem&apos;s mention to a wounded guy with a bloodied shirt pleading for compassion. In the absence of these agonizing words, the speaker becomes a rebel against the system.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the subsequent stanzas, the speaker presents our society&apos;s and nature&apos;s damaged paths. The dominated person&apos;s voice is locked. It&apos;s like hide and seek. For example, deforested area, rhododendron blooming in January and sorrowful bird calls represent the erosion of societal values and natural circumstances. People&apos;s indifferent, greedy, and criminal actions have disrupted and harmed the world and its species. In the last verse, the speaker expresses his yearning for independence for himself and other earth animals. He like a nice, tranquil sky with soothing storm sounds.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>What is the meaning of &apos;soft storm&apos;?&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Abhi Subedi used two opposing words &lsquo;soft storm&apos; to title his poem because of the lawless nation and chaotic atmosphere. A storm is merely poor weather, but the poet perceives it as a chaotic environment in modern civilization.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;When does the speaker grow soft? Enlist the occasions when he grows soft.</b> </p> <p>The speaker softens as he hears uproar, the sky blooms like crocuses, the moon skids, hungry children weep, a lonesome kid looks for his mother, a man is mercilessly beaten, etc.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do you understand by &apos;this seamless city&apos;?</b> </p> <p>It refers to an lawless urbanised environment where people may freely wander without social disruptions or issues and enjoy the true blessings of freedom and pleasure without bias.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Describe the poor children portrayed in the poem.</b> </p> <p>Hunger and poverty make children weep beneath the bat-bearing trees of Keshar Mahal in Thamel. They are deprived of the constitutionally guaranteed liberties they are entitled to.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do you understand about the unwedded gardens of history&apos;?</b> </p> <p>The term &quot;unwedded gardens of history&quot; refers to the society&apos;s previous unflourished events, which is a metaphor for Nepal&apos;s lawless, chaotic state as a result of sociopolitical dominance.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why was the forlorn child wailing?</b> </p> <p>A forlorn child was wailing because he was lost from his mother.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What do you understand about &apos;soft storm&apos;?</b> </p> <p>Done in the first minutes!</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does the speaker call our time &apos;mad time&apos;?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The speaker refers to our period as &quot;crazy time&rdquo; because he discovers corruption, bias, political and social inequality, cruelty, and environmental devastation everywhere.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the speaker want to do during his &quot;Hard times&quot;?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The speaker wishes to fade like a rainbow at &quot;Hard times.&quot;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The poet uses the word &apos;soft&apos; with the words like &apos;storm&apos; and &apos;gale&apos;, which generally refer to disorder and violence. What effect does the poet achieve through the use of such anomalous expressions?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>An anomalous phrase is a syntactically correct but semantically meaningless utterance. The most famous examples are &apos;soft storm&apos; and &apos;softness surged like a gale&apos;. To convey his inner feelings and realisations in today&apos;s restricted culture, he unites two opposing notions. Through this method, the poet gains psychological, social, and environmental benefits.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the speaker feel about the historical period he describes?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;The speaker&apos;s perspective on time is skewed since he can&apos;t think of any specific human activities that take place at certain times. At night, when the moon shines in the sky, it casts a shadow or is less brilliant than the brightly shining Sun. Wherever he expects things to happen, he encounters difficulties. As a result, the speaker seems to have a negative outlook on the passage of time throughout the poem.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is the speaker like? A rebel? Why? Why not?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The speaker seems rebellious. He is waiting for the right moment to rebel, but his inner nature is distrubed by the circumstances like social, familial, political, and environmental. In the poem, he seems to oppose authority and violate norms, yet his rebellious attitude is gentle and repressed.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Explain the following stanza:&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p><b><i>I became soft</i></b></p> <p><b><i>when I saw</i></b></p> <p><b><i>a blood-stained shirt</i></b></p> <p><b><i>speaking in the earth&rsquo;s ears</i></b></p> <p><b><i>with bruised human lips</i></b></p> <p><b><i>in the far corner</i></b></p> <p><b><i>under the moon</i></b></p> <p><b><i>of history and dreams</i></b></p> <p><b><i>playing hide and seek</i></b></p> <p><b><i>in open museums</i></b></p> <p><b><i>of human times.</i></b></p> <p><br></p> <p>From Abhi Subedi&apos;s poem &lsquo;Soft Storm&apos;, the author describes a guy with bloodstained clothing and wounded lips who is unable to speak because his voice is suppressed. The lines depict the plight of the underprivileged and downtrodden.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay, highlighting your dissatisfaction towards social, cultural, economic and political issues prevailing in Nepal at present.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Nepal&apos;s Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political Issues</p> <p>I&apos;m dissatisfied with many aspects of today&apos;s society, including gender inequality, discrimination against women, the trafficking of girls, violence against women, and more.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>I reject this multiparty democratic system that is not based on the rule of law and human rights, which are merely referred to in the constitution as &quot;independence,&quot; &quot;freedom,&quot; and &quot;fairness,&quot; and which only exists on paper. Those in charge of the country&apos;s politics are basically playing dirty politics, disrespecting the constitutional rights of the people.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Nepotism and favouritism are rampant, and the whole system is riddled with them. A quarter of Nepal&apos;s population is still living below the poverty level despite UN forecasts that poverty is decreasing. There are disparities in Values and Customs.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>A large segment of Nepal&apos;s population is unable to engage in public events and attain social and cultural equality because of the country&apos;s economic and social conditions, social shame, and restricted access to education.</p> <p><br></p> <p>This country&apos;s social system is something with which I strongly disagree. Dalits, the most disadvantaged group in the caste system, are particularly affected by the lack of economic possibilities and restrictions they face as a result of their status.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Assume you&apos;re a rebel seeking to transform society by eradicating social injustices and inconsistencies. A speech articulating your vision for change should be written.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Respected ladies and gentlemen, and my dear friends.&nbsp;</p> <p>Greetings! I&apos;m Shriram Lamichhane, and I&apos;m here today to speak out against the plethora of social ills that are stifling our country&apos;s progress.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Though we are in modern society, there are many widespread societal ills, including drunkenness, racism and child abuse. The caste system, child labor, underage marriage, illiteracy and gender inequality are just some of the socioeconomic ills that Nepal is dealing with.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>One of the socioeconomic problems is illiteracy. It is our responsibility as educated individuals to raise awareness for increasing the approach of education among the ignorant population.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Secondly, there is the problem of child labor and child marriage. Without education, a youngster is like a bird that has no wings. In today&apos;s environment, if your kid does not have a decent education, he or she may encounter many difficulties. There is an ideal time and place for any endeavour. Encourage your children to study until they are ready to begin working.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Classes were established by our forefathers thousands of years ago, based on the occupations of their people. The most oppressed of them were the Sudras, who were the lowest of the low castes. People weren&apos;t even permitted to enter the temples.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The issue of poverty must be addressed as soon as feasible. There are three main factors that contribute to poverty: illiteracy, caste, and unemployment. Training for the jobless should be provided by the government.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Inadequacy in hygienic conditions is another societal blight. Every citizen has a responsibility to clean up our nation.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Inequality between men and women has become another problem. The narrow-mindedness of society is to blame for both of these tragedies.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>There is much work to be done in order to rid our society of the last vestiges of the social ills that still exist. We must educate the public in order to address all of the problems.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>All of these ills are intertwined. To combat these societal ills, we need to be educated in the appropriate way with morals and ethics. The government has to act more effectively and strive to eliminate these issues from the public discourse.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>I&apos;ll wrap things up here. Everyone, thank you, and I wish you all the best in your efforts to rid society of these social ills as quickly as possible.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Thank You !</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Original Answers : (RAW)</b></p> <p>When does the speaker grow soft? Enlist the occasions when he grows soft.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The speaker grows soft in several occasions such as when he hears the tumult, the sky grows like crocuses, the moon skids down, homeless children cry due to hunger, a forlorn child cries and searches for his mother, a man beaten mercilessly and so on.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What do you understand by &apos;this seamless city&apos;?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>By this seamless city&apos; means a city where inhabitants can walk freely without any social interruptions or problems and realize the real fruits of freedom and happiness beyond partiality.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Describe the poor children portrayed in the poem.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>Poor homeless and parentless children cry due to hunger and poverty under the bat-bearing trees of Kesharmahal in Thamel. They are deprived of their fundamental rights mentioned in the constitution.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What do you understand by the unwedded gardens of history&apos;?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>By &apos;unwedded gardens of history&apos; means the past unflourished incidences of the society which literally means lawless disturbed chaos situation created by social and political hegemony in the Nepalese society.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Why was the forlorn child wailing?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>A forlorn child was wailing because he found his mother and other kins and dear ones missing in the contemporary society.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What do you understand by &apos;soft storm&apos;?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>The two opposite words &apos;soft storm&apos; combined by Abhi Subedi title to his poem, means inner disturbed feelings of the poet due to lawless society and chaos environment. A storm simply mean bad weather but connecting soft with it means tumultuous atmosphere which the poet sees in the contemporary society.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Why does the speaker call our time &apos;mad time&apos;?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>The speaker calls our time as &apos;mad time&apos; in the sense it i not under control of the constitution or the law of the nation. He finds corruption, partiality, political and social injustice among the people, animal laws in practice and degradation of nature everywhere in the society.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What does the speaker want to do in &quot;hard times&quot;?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>The speaker wants to melt like a rainbow in &apos;hard times&apos; because he is soft hearted by nature.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;The poet uses the word &apos;soft&apos; with the words like &apos;storm&apos; and &apos;gale&apos;, which generally refer to disorder and violence. What effect does the poet achieve through the use of such anomolous expressions?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>A sentence that is syntactically well formed but semantically meaningless is called anomolous expression. The best-known example in the poem is &apos;soft storm&apos; and &apos;softness rose like a galeit is inconsistent with what is usual, normal, or expected and is paradoxical in nature. Through this, the poet obtains psychological, social, political and environmental effects. He connects two opposite ideas to express his inner experiences that he feels and realizes in the contemporary suppressed society.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What is the speaker&apos;s attitude towards the time he describes in the poem?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>The poem has been set in the night time when the moon is shinning in the sky which itself is shadowed or not as bright as shinning Sun. The speaker&apos;s attitude towards time is not as good as he finds no particular work in particular times conducted by humans. Time itself is mad in the sense it is cylindrical in shape and moves in round framework and is under control of noneHe finds hard times everywhere, where ng Auto expected things take place. Thus, the speaker has not positive attitude with the time in the poem.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;What is the speaker like? Is he a rebel? Why? Why not?&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>The speaker looks like a rebel. His situation is as same as the animals in &apos;Animal Farm&apos; by D.H. Lawrence as they are waiting for appropriate time to revolt and this nature of revolt is found in suppressed form. Social, familial political and environmental circumstances are responsible to be him so. As a rebel, he seems to challenge authority and break the rules every now and then but his rebellious nature is not presented in radical form rather it is presented in soft and suppressed form in the poem.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p>Explain the stanza below in your own words :&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>I became soft when I saw a blood-stained shirt speaking in the earth&apos;s ears with bruised human lips in the far corner under the moon of history and dreams playing hide and seek in open museums of human times.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>These given lines are from fourth stanza of the poem Soft Storm&apos; by Abhi Subedi where the poet talks about a man with blood-stained shirt and bruised human lips who is unable to speak any thing as his Auto is locked by the powerful inhabitants in the night time. The game of hide and seek is associated with the landowners and the workers where the rights of the workers are under control of the landowners Miserable condition of the poor and marginalized ones is expressed through the given lines.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Write an essay, highlighting your dissatisfaction towards social, cultural, economic and political issues prevailing in Nepal at present.&nbsp; </p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p>Social, cultural, Economic and Political Issues Prevailing in Nepal : An Essay&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p>A large section of the population in Nepal cannot access political participation and representation to public affairs and obtain social and cultural equality due to economic and social conditions, social stigma and lack of access to information among other reasons. Political Issues : I opposes this competitive multiparty democratic system of governance which is not stable by its nature and rule of law, human rights and fundamental rights mentioned in the constitution, only named independence and free and fair judiciary as these things are only projected in the documents, not in the practical life of the people. The political leaders are just playing the game of dirty politics violating the rights of the people and constitution Social and Economic Issues : Old caste system like Dalits is the most discriminated people under this system who suffer from restriction and economic opportunities in the society. I totally disagree with such sort of social system in the country. There is wide spread corruption everywhere and nepotism and favouritism is prevalent in the society. Although the UN estimates that poverty in Nepal has been dropping down gradually but a quarter of the population are still below the poverty line. Cultural Issues Auto-F Gender inequality, discrimination against women, girls trafficking, violence against women and many more are the obstacles of the current society I am not satisfied with.&nbsp;</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> &nbsp;Suppose you are a rebel, who wants to change the society by eliminating malpractices and anomalies prevailing in the society. Draft a speech outlining your vision for change.&nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>Good morning everyone. Respected ladies and gentlemen and my dear friends I am Sundar Shrestha and today we have gathered here against malpractices and anomalies being practiced in the society and how they are becoming hurdles for our country&apos;s development Some of the common social malpractices or social evils being practiced in our society are alcoholism, racism, child abuse, etc. Besides, Nepal is facing a large number of social problems such as caste system, child labor, child marriage, illiteracy, gender inequality, superstitions, religious conflicts and much more. Social evils are the issues opposed by most people of the society. In ancient days, our ancestors have divided classes according to their people&apos;s occupation like Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and SudrasSudras are the most suppressed people. The other three castes people don&apos;t even touch them and even they were not allowed into the temples. These were the adverse effects. The second issue is child labor and child marriage. A child without education is a bird without wings. Without proper education, your child would face a lot of problem in this modern world. There is the right age to do everything. Make your children study until he is ready for the work. Illiteracy is also one of the social issues. Educated people like us have to bring awareness to the illiterate people.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Poverty is a significant problem to be solved as quick as possible. The cause of poverty is illiteracy, caste system, and unemployment. The government should provide training for the unemployed. Sanitation and uncleanliness is also a social evil. The reason is people&apos;s carelessness and laziness. Every person must strive to make our country clean. Gender inequality and low status for women had become familiar. The reason for both of these evils is the narrow mindset of society. All these evils are interconnected. They stop most of our future citizens. To deal with these social evils, we have to get the right education with values. The government has to work more efficiently and try to eradicate these problems. &bull; To check all the issues, the first and the foremost step should be to educate people. A lot needs to be done to eradicate the shreds of a number of social evils still haunting our society. In Albert Einstein&apos;s words &apos;The world is dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who don&apos;t do anything about it.&quot; With this, I conclude my speech. Thank you, everyone, and I wish you all the best and to get succeed in your objectives of eradicating these social malpractices from the society as soon as possible.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p>********</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p>"

      "story": " <p><b>Summary</b></p> <p>This essay is a personal essay about Oliver Sacks, who was a bookworm and fond of reading books in libraries.&nbsp;</p> <p>While growing up, Oliver Sacks lived in an oak paneled library left to him by his father, a Hebrew scholar and admirer of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906). Books by Henrik Ibsen, poetry by his father&apos;s generation, and adventure and history books owned by his siblings filled the shelves of their family&apos;s library.&nbsp;</p> <p>He&apos;d read Rudyard Kipling&apos;s The Jungle Book, an English short story writer. He was captivated by the story of Mowgli, a fictitious character in the book.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the library, There was a separate cabinet reserved by his parents, where medical related books were kept. His mother also possessed a large collection of literature, including works by American poet&nbsp;<b>Emily Dickinson, English novelist Anthony Trollope, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, British author Rudyard Kipling, and poets William Shakespeare and John Milton, as well as poetry volumes she&apos;d won in school contests.&nbsp;</b>His mother, like him, loved literature. Since he was three or four years old, the library and books had been a fond memory for him. The library was stunning, but he also had a small lab&nbsp;<b>where he could lose himself in literature and forget about food for hours at a time.</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>He received a proper education in Willesden Public library. St&nbsp;<b>Paul&apos;s School&apos;s Walker Library lacked chemistry books, so he went to the Science Museum Library with his schoolmaster and picked out what he needed from their collection of chemical books.</b> When he was an adult, he delved into fields like astronomy and chemistry. He was an excellent student in libraries and a voracious reader who enjoyed the company of other bookworms as much as he did his own work. One of his favorite places to spend time as an adult was the Willesden Public Library in Willesden Green, London. He disliked passive reading in formal schools since he was an active reader who was used to studying on his own.</p> <p><br></p> <p>When he was a student, he went to the Radcliffe Science Library and the Bodleian Library in Oxford. After reading Theodore Hook&apos;s work, he made the decision to write a biography on the author. A biography of him was published in the Bodleian Library after he had gathered documents from the British Museum Library. He studied old works like Gesner&apos;s Historiae Animalium (1551), Agassiz&apos;s writings, Charles Darwin, Sir Thomas Browne, and Jonathan Swift, as well as 17th and 18th century works by Samuel Johnson, David Hume, Alexander Pope, and John Dryden. The library at Queen&apos;s College, Oxford, was his favorite.</p> <p><br></p> <p>He was awarded a full scholarship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he had no trouble reading or writing. He formed a strong bond with a fellow reader, with whom he enjoyed reading and conversing. The year was 1965, and he had just moved to New York City, where he had a little apartment. Although reading and writing were tough in the flat, he nevertheless managed to complete portions of his book Migraine. &nbsp;He ran across another person looking for the same old book, Volumes of Brain from 1890.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Oliver went on to other libraries, where he sat at a table surrounded by piles of books. In the 1990s,&nbsp;<b>he saw that pupils were using computers instead of bookshelves to gather knowledge.</b> The college decided to get rid of all the books since most of the students weren&apos;t utilizing them. A similar occurrence occurred at the AECOM Library as well as in libraries located in other countries. The vast majority of the books had been discarded. To him, this amounted to a murder or other serious offense.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The eradication or replacement of the books amounted to the eradication of centuries&apos; worth of knowledge. His heart was broken when he saw how many precious volumes had been destroyed by fire. Digital books lack the ability to wow and thrill the reader in the same way physical books do. There are certain novels that can&apos;t be replaced after they&apos;ve been read. In the 1960s, most libraries had separate areas only for ancient books. This things have been analysed in this essay. Hope you liked the summary.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Understanding the text&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Where could the author be found when he was late for lunch or dinner?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The author was a voracious reader and fond of reading books. His only time pass was to study books. He used to go to the library in his spare time. That&apos;s why he could be found in the library if he was ever late for dinner.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are his first memories?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>When the author was a child, he was introduced to books and libraries since his parents were fond of books, especially his mother. So, we can say that books and libraries are the first memories of the author.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did he dislike school?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Theoretical and obligatory teachings methods of the school were not liked by the author. Studying becomes easier and a matter of interest when a student studies with his/her own genuine interest, not by any obligation or instruction. Since, the school was not as he thought, he disliked it.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What did he feel about the library?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>Library was silent, providing him a peaceful environment to study and ponder in his studies. It gave him the freedom to browse through tens of thousands of books. He was free to wander around the library and read whatever he wanted. He also used to be joined by other readers who shared his passion for learning.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why was he so biassed about sciences, especially astronomy and chemistry?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>From childhood, the author was keen on reading books in the science field because it was a curious and ponderous subject for him. Because science was his field of study, he had a strong predisposition for fields like astronomy and chemistry. Focusing our research on a particular topic is necessary to get a broad understanding of that topic, which is why the author studied astronomy and chemistry to gain more specialised knowledge. One cannot possibly read all of the books in a library&apos;s collection since they cover a wide range of topics and abilities. So, he narrowed down his field of study.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did he become so fascinated by Hook?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>He became so fascinated by Hook because of his satire and operas. The early nineteenth-century theatre and music worlds adored him for his humour and musical improvisational ability.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Describe the library at the Queen&rsquo;s College.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The Queen&apos;s College Library is a revered baroque building in Oxford. In addition, the 17th-century Upper Library is available to students as a reading space. The renovation was required to maintain the space&apos;s historical importance and to offer readers a pleasant and engaging environment. The restoration, initially intended to be part of the Library&apos;s expansion, was completed between June 2013 and January 2014. It is now cleaner, brighter, and more inviting to study.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did the students ignore the bookshelves in the 1990s?</b> </p> <p>= The students ignored the bookshelves in the 90s because they had electronic gadgets and devices from where they could access the PDF and electronic forms of their books.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why was he horrified when he visited the library a couple of months ago?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>He was horrified when he visited the library a couple of months ago because, He discovered the shelves, which had previously been full, were then empty. It seems that most of the books had been thrown away in the past several years, with surprisingly little opposition. He felt as though a murder, a crime had been committed by the erasure of centuries&apos; worth of information.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the context&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;The author says, &ldquo;I was not a good pupil, but I was a good listener.&rdquo; Justify it with the textual evidence.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=</b> Oliver Sacks enjoys reading a wide range of genres at the library since it&apos;s free. He was not a fan of learning in a passive manner in which, in school, he must complete all of the teacher&apos;s homework after the lectures. Oliver Sacks writes in the article, &quot;I wasn&apos;t a good student, but I was an excellent learner.&quot; He says so, because he was never interested in doing as per the instructions of school. He says so because he was not like the students defined by the academic terminology. But, it does not mean he was arrogant. He used to study by choosing books from libraries that interest him. To do well in school, one must have a positive relationship with their instructors. He/she is required to attend courses on a regular basis and follow the directions of the instructors. Oliver Sacks, on the other hand, was not that kind of student. That is why, author describes himself as a good listener, rather than a good student.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;A proverb says, &quot;Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library.&quot; Does this proverb apply in the essay? Explain.</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>When you go into a library and see other people studying, it gives you the feeling that you should be doing the same thing. They provide a more serene atmosphere than the average house. In addition, the library is a great place to go if you need a specific reference book. Not everyone has a dedicated study room in their house, and there may be other distractions such as regular visits from family members. Also, you won&apos;t be bothered much by anybody around. Library does not have TVs and mobile phones, which are the major distractions. That&apos;s why the library is more pleasurable than anything else.</p> <p>A library&apos;s vast collection of books and periodicals covers a wide range of subjects. Oliver Sacks particularly cherished the library&apos;s meditative atmosphere and the company of other bookworms. In fact, he is an avid reader who spends a lot of time in libraries. His favourite room in his house was the oak-panelled library. He opted out of going to school and instead spent his time reading in public libraries. Reading books offers a bookish person as much pleasure as anything else. He aspires to have a desk in a library, with a stack of books in front of him at all times. He grew up in a house filled with bookworms who liked to read. Walter Savage Landor discusses the joy that may be found in a library by anybody who is interested in studying. He began reading from his own personal library at home. That&apos;s why &quot;There&apos;s nothing more enjoyable than browsing a library,&quot;, a lovely quote, is completely relatable to the essay.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Are there any other services that you would like to see added to the library?</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>A library should not be only a store of books. Time is changing. Various technologies are evolving. The way students study and learn has been changed, so we also need to adapt to changing technology in the libraries and learning systems as well. For example, a Braille system could be introduced in the libraries to assist blind students studying their studies. We can also use various ICT materials like informative TV&apos;s and DVD&apos;s which students can use to better visualise the things. Also, the Internet Wikipedia system should be added to the library so that students can find their desired things via the Internet rather than searching for the books on the bookshelves. Similarly, A simple cafe can optionally be added outside the library so that whenever the learners get hungry, they can have some food.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay on Libraries and its uses for students.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><b>=&nbsp;</b>The Library is a gathering place for people of all interests to study books of all genres on their own. &nbsp;Students may gain information by borrowing books from the library. The library may be an invaluable resource for those who cannot afford to purchase a book, particularly students who cannot afford to buy a book. Private, public, and government libraries all exist. The library serves a variety of functions and disseminates information. The library is the beating heart of the educational system and for the students.</p> <p>In order to avoid desire and temptation, people should stay in contact with libraries. Libraries play a critical role in unlocking the secrets of the universe by storing vast amounts of information. A book takes us from the darkness of ignorance to the light of understanding. Libraries, more than any other medium, are the most effective method of disseminating knowledge.</p> <p>Many students go to the library to do research or look for information on current events or social problems. For the objectives of education and knowledge acquisition, libraries are vital. Students may develop good reading and study habits by using libraries, which serves to enrich the classroom experience. Libraries can even help students develop a feeling of accountability. Libraries are just too cool for words! Once history books teach us from the errors of the past, we can avoid them in the future.</p> <p>Aside from that, it will come as a shock to the younger generation to learn that not everything can be found on the internet. Although the Internet makes libraries more accessible, it does not entirely replace them. It&apos;s also been said that giving a kid a book as a present is the best thing a parent can do for them. It&apos;s possible that the Internet has many errors that weren&apos;t noticed at the time. It provides all potential answers to academic problems. Newspapers and articles from local publications are often available in libraries to keep patrons updated on current happenings. With the help of the library, one&apos;s ability to focus is greatly enhanced. In addition, libraries are places where we may meet others who share our interests and so contribute to the development of our social network. When a student begins consulting reference materials, their grades increase.</p> <p>Modern libraries provide their patrons with much more than just books; they now provide CDs, DVDs, and even E-books. Many contemporary libraries now provide online guest lectures and seminars by eminent philosophers on fascinating subjects. People have lost sight of the importance of libraries in the era of television, computers, and the internet. The majority of libraries have now made their free WIFI services available to job seekers so they may take use of the free internet access. The government&apos;s role in modernising libraries may be observed. They provide digital libraries and other services all around the world.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Do you have any public libraries in your locality? If so, do the people in your community use it? Give a couple of examples.</b> </p> <p>= Yes, we do have a public library in our society. There is no reason not to, libraries have played a critical part in the development of the civilised society we live in now and will continue to do so as we repair and extend our capacity for learning and information acquisition. As a result, learning and libraries are inseparable in my community.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Because the technology we use now isn&apos;t available to everyone in society, libraries are vital. In libraries, reading sessions for students and the community are organised, as are book sales, library groups, and other activities that serve to mould society and make it better and more educated. A library is a location where you may discover information on topics you&apos;re interested in learning about or are required to know about. It&apos;s also a location where you may relax and have fun (hopefully). There&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll make new friends.</p> <p><br></p> <p>For local people who need it, a library is essential because they use computers to accomplish things like pay bills or compose emails while they do their schoolwork or study, via the computers available in libraries. Some people are fortunate enough to be able to accomplish such things at home, but not everyone is.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>While technology may fail from time to time due to power outages or worn-out components, libraries remain open and are much more dependable. Because libraries continue to function as a physical repository for information and knowledge in our society, they are vital institutions to have in place. In order for any information to be uploaded into the technology, it must first be manuscripted and then stored in libraries just in case information is lost during transportation. That is why libraries are inseparable in my community.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> "

      "story": "<p><b>Summary</b></p> <p>Marriage is an institution. The connection between married couples is governed by rules, and they coexist within flexible parameters to follow the same patterns in different ways. Marriage differs from all other types of partnerships in that it has soft boundaries&mdash;allowable limitations on actions. Such an institution separates married couples from all other types of relationships. They become a part of a huge system of well-understood concepts that assist in organizing and maintaining human existence.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Understanding the Text</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following Questions.</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;According to the author, what is marriage?</b> </p> <p>Ans: Marriage is the union of two people who are legally, morally, and culturally linked together and have a wide range of intimate personal relationships.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How is marriage an institution?</b> </p> <p>Ans: - Marriage is considered as an institution because marriage is a social and legal structure that serves many functions for a community.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the rules that a marriage has?</b> </p> <p>Ans: Marriage is a complex set of principles that guarantee the rights of the spouses to each other and the rights of children within a society.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does marriage matter to men?</b> </p> <p>Ans: - Marriage matters to men because it gives them direction in life and helps them achieve their goals.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is one of the central problems in modern society?</b> </p> <p>Ans: - In contemporary civilization, a major issue is putting reasonable limits on modern people&apos;s insatiable demands for well-being, luxury, opulence, and renown.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does a social capital consist of?</b> </p> <p>Ans: - Social capital is made up of a vast network of people who are all connected together by a common connection of reliability and trustworthiness.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is normative marriage?</b> </p> <p>Ans: - Normative marriage is the marriage which follows social norms and values. The six characteristics of normative marriage in the United States are, for example: marriages are joined freely by mature, heterosexual individuals; husbands are the primary earners; partners are sexually faithful; and parents are involved.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the Context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Discuss the six dimensions that define normative marriage in America.</b> </p> <p>Ans: - The six characteristics of normative marriage in the United States are, for example: marriages are joined freely by mature, heterosexual individuals; husbands are the primary earners; partners are sexually faithful; and parents are involved.&nbsp;Every union adheres to a set of rules and patterns, and this is no different in the United States. The idea of getting married is not pushed on you by anybody. In America, the type of marriage called as normative marriage follows six characteristics. The first point to make is that getting married is a personal choice. Both spouses must be loyal to one another, especially when it comes to sexual activity. The marital relationship must be heterosexual (opposite sexes). And it is only after getting married that they are able to have children of their own. Marriage occurs all throughout the world, although the definition varies from area to area. Every culture has its own set of marital rules and ideals. Whatever it is, it allows two people of opposite sexes the legal right to live together as life partners and satisfy each other&apos;s wishes. Adults are capable of managing their own marriages. Husbands will take over as the primary breadwinners after marriage. They&apos;re responsible for supporting large families.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Do marriages differ according to culture? How is your marriage practice different from marriage in America?</b> </p> <p>Ans: - I am hindu and in Hinduism, here&nbsp;are certain norms and values to be followed in marriage ceremony. For us, marriage is a social, spiritual, cultural and legal union between a man and a woman as husband and wife. However, the majority of people in Nepal practice marriage ceremony according to Hindu religion. &nbsp;It is also establishment of relation between two families. The differences can be observed not only across the country but there are varieties within a country.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marriage practices differ place to place. The marriage practices of one geographic location are different to other even in our country.&nbsp;Because we adhere to Hindu tradition while the United States adheres to Christian tradition, our marriage rituals vary from those in the West. In US, Church-provided vows are used by the bride and groom to declare their undying love and devotion to one another. He(one who mediates in marriage) then goes around the room and asks everyone if they can think of anything that would stop this pair from getting married. If no one disagrees, the couple will exchange rings as a sign of their unending love and devotion to one another. With their first kiss, the pair publicly proclaims themselves as husband and wife for the first time. A religious authority officiates at the wedding ceremony, which takes place in a religious structure called a church, however in Hinduism, marriage are done through the traditional or residential houses or even in Hindu temples.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay on the marriage practice in your own culture.</b> </p> <p>I belong to Hindu religion, and we have our own rules of marriage. There are various types of marriage in our societies, including monogamy, in which one person is allowed to have only one spouse, serial monogamy, in which one spouse remarries after the death or divorce of the first spouse, polygamy, in which one person has multiple spouses, polyandry, in which one wife has multiple husbands, and polygyny, in which one husband has multiple wives, endogamy, in which one marriage is within a group, and exogamy, in which one The idea of marriage is evolving rapidly. For example, our culture today accepts transgender marriage, a relationship that was formerly taboo. Marriage is more than just a way to satisfy a sexual urge between two adults of different sexes.</p> <p>No one in our culture considers marriage to be a social contract. It&apos;s a legally recognized union between a mature man and a mature woman for reproduction, pleasure, and social obligations. A girl&apos;s and a boy&apos;s party organize an engagement. Before choosing one another, the couples exchange rings and garlands. In this event, family priests chant mantra and perform rites. The wedding date is also fixed the same day. At the day of marriage, The bridegroom is followed by a musical ensemble named &apos;Janti.&apos; &apos;Saipata&apos;, a group of women bearing trays full of food and gifts, leads Janti. On that day, the bride&apos;s family priests perform the wedding ceremony at her house. The whole procession passes through the groom&apos;s home&apos;s Mandap or Jagey.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Hinduism, the Pandit, or priest, is the most respected person. The priest instructs numerous actions in the Mandap&apos;s center holy fire. The bridegroom pours vermillion powder on her head and puts a holy necklace around her neck in addition to the seven times around the sacred fire. The most apparent indications of a married lady are &apos;Sindur&apos; crimson face powder and &apos;Pote&apos; holy jewelry. Everyone in the family and society wished them luck on their marriage. The bride will leave her parents&apos; home at the end of the day. This is the movie&apos;s most emotional scene. Most of the bride&apos;s family members cried as they left. The newlyweds are warmly welcomed at the bridegroom&apos;s household. A huge throng has gathered to watch the new bridegroom, who has ceased singing and dancing. So the newlyweds start a new life together.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Is marriage a Social Institution? Discuss.</b> </p> <p>There are different methods of marriage from culture to culture. However, in every marriages, People of both sexes satisfy their wants and aspirations through being accepted into society and adhering to societal norms and values. In the past, child marriage was acceptable, but not anymore. Widow marriage is now allowed, and transgender marriage is now lawful, giving the offspring born to the married pair legal privileges such as birth registration and citizenship certification.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Definition of marriage as a social institution differs from people to people. The idea of marriage is fluid because of the differences between the traditional marital system and the one in use today. Generally speaking, a marriage is described as a legally binding union between two individuals of different sexes who have a personal connection, live together as a couple, work together, have children, and satisfy each other&apos;s sexual needs.&nbsp;</p> <p>The term &quot;marriage&quot; has been defined precisely by sociologists. Since the dawn of human civilisation, it has been practiced by every nation, every community, and every group. It will last till the end of human civilization, since it is eternal. Institutions like this are set up by people to lawfully meet their demands from various persons, places, and things. We see it as a formal entity due to its adherence to long-established rules, customs, patterns and conventions that are critical to a society&apos;s well-being. In every culture, people marry each other.</p> <p><br></p>"

      "title": "Knowledge and Wisdom",
      "story": " <p><b>Knowledge and Wisdom&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Summary</b></p> <p>Bertrand Arthur William Russell, a British writer, wrote &lsquo;Knowledge and Wisdom&apos;. Russell distinguishes knowledge and wisdom in this essay. Wisdom is not knowledge. He defines knowledge as the gathering of facts and information, but wisdom is the application and use of knowledge to generate value. Wisdom comes from study and experience, not memorization.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In this article, the author discusses numerous aspects of wisdom. His definition of wisdom includes:</p> <p><br></p> <p> i)&nbsp;sense of proportion ii) awareness and feeling </p> <p>iii) freedom from bias</p> <p> iv) objectivity v) mental component </p> <p><br></p> <p>Russell defines wisdom in the first half of this article, and then discusses how to get it in the second. Wisdom cannot progress without information. He claims that wisdom and knowledge must both be pursued at the same time. As a result, Russel&apos;s precise explanations are wonderful gifts of knowledge and wisdom. It demonstrates Russel&apos;s mastery of clear style. His brain is razor-sharp, and his perspective is expansive.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Only having knowledge or wisdom isn&apos;t enough. Both are equally valuable. Wisdom without knowledge may be dangerous. Even having all of the facts isn&apos;t enough. It is vital to blend information with wisdom. To choose our life&apos;s objective, we need intelligence. We need it in order to be free of personal biases. To prevent hate for one another, wisdom is required. For understanding each other, we require wisdom.&nbsp;</p> <p><p><b>Exercise</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the factors that contribute to wisdom?</b> </p> <p>In the essay &quot;Knowledge and Wisdom,&quot; Bertrand Russell discusses numerous factors that lead to wisdom. Among the characteristics that lead to wisdom, according to him, are:&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>(I) a sense of proportion,&nbsp;</p> <p>(ii) comprehensiveness with wide emotion,&nbsp;</p> <p>(iii) emancipation from personal biases and sensory experience, (iv) impartiality, and&nbsp;</p> <p>(v) knowledge of human needs and understanding.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What message does the writer try to convey with the examples of technicians?</b> </p> <p>Russell has provided several examples of technicians to illustrate the dangers of relying only on technical expertise. They&apos;re unable to see how their expertise in one subject may be detrimental in another. Population expansion and food shortages may result from the discovery of a treatment that lowers newborn mortality. Atomic physics may be abused in the same way to create atomic weapons.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Which leaders does Russell say were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly?</b> </p> <p>It is said that Henry IV of France and Abraham Lincoln are examples of people who are able to combine knowledge and wisdom successfully, according to Russell. Queen Elizabeth I and Henry IV were undisturbed by the battle between the Protestants and the Catholics, which allowed them to stay free from the faults of their period. Like Abraham Lincoln, who never deviated from the path of wisdom during the Civil War.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why is wisdom needed not only in public ways but in private life equally?</b> </p> <p>When it comes to wisdom, it may be applied in both professional and personal contexts at the same time. It&apos;s essential for making decisions about goals and objectives, as well as for letting go of one&apos;s own biases. Without wisdom, we may not be able to choose our life&apos;s purpose or have the patience to persuade others about it.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What, according to Russell, the true aim of education?</b> </p> <p>According to Russell, the fundamental goal of education is to instill knowledge in individuals. Wisdom is the ability to apply what we&apos;ve learned in the classroom to the real world in a way that doesn&apos;t hurt others or ourselves. To be decent citizens, individuals need more than just information. They need wisdom, too.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Can wisdom be taught? If so, how?</b> </p> <p>It is possible to acquire knowledge, according to this stance. Wisdom should be taught with a greater emphasis on logic and reasoning than on morality. In the process of imparting information, people who harbor animosity and narrow-mindedness may unwittingly learn about the devastating consequences of their actions. An atom bomb, for example, can only be made by misusing an atom&apos;s composition, thus it&apos;s important to educate students about the consequences of its abuse.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the Context</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;According to Russell, &ldquo;The Pursuit of Knowledge may become harmful unless it is combined with wisdom.&rdquo; Justify this statement.</b> </p> <p>People are interested and want to learn new things, thus the answer is yes. Most individuals have dedicated their whole life to learning. Humans may benefit from certain knowledge, but we can also be harmed by other types of information as well. We may benefit from wisdom and knowledge since it meets the needs of all people. Making weapons with the understanding of atomic composition has made it dangerous to humankind. Hegal, despite his vast knowledge of history, convinced the Germans that they were the superior race. There were terrible conflicts as a result of it. Knowledge must be paired with a sense of compassion. To determine our life&apos;s purpose, we need a defining moment. It liberates us from our own preconceived notions about other people. In the absence of discernment, even great things might be employed in imprudent ways.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What, according to Russell, is the essence of wisdom? And how can one acquire the very essence?</b> </p> <p>According to Russell, it is freedom from the tyranny of bias. There is less focus on our physical health when we don&apos;t think about it. Wisdom is what elevates us to a greater level of spirituality by causing us to care and love the whole human race. To make the appropriate judgment, we need to have a wide perspective and an open mind. Understanding the end of human existence, properly using our knowledge, establishing noble and achievable objectives, managing our sensory perceptions, progressively becoming impartial and loving others are all ways in which we might gain the essence.</p> <p><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Reference Beyond the Text</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions.</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why is wisdom necessary in education? Discuss.</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Wisdom allows us to see the world in a more expansive and objective way. The intimacy of our thoughts and emotions diminishes as we get older. So that we may properly use what we&apos;ve learned. It enables us to put our knowledge to good use for the greater good of humanity. In the presence of knowledge, we are able to love even our adversaries, to entirely shed our ego and to be free of every bias. Education/knowledge is a component in a person&apos;s life, but so is wisdom. In order to achieve perfection, one must be able to handle both of these aspects. In addition to teaching information, education aims to cultivate decent people. People who lack wisdom, which does not come to them naturally but must be taught, may abuse the newfound information they&apos;ve gathered. As an educational aim, it should be taught in schools. When it&apos;s first planted, it has to be nurtured by real-world examples.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How can you become wise? Do you think what you are doing in college contributes to wisdom?</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Wisdom is a tough notion to describe, but we can all identify it when we see it in action. Wise people are self-aware, open to new ideas, and cognizant of the fact that the world around them is continuously changing.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Wisdom takes time to acquire. WISE GROWTH IS POSSIBLE ONLY THROUGH PATIENCE AND DISCIPLINE. Wise reasoning is linked to a higher quality of life, less negative emotions, better interpersonal interactions, and less depressed thinking. Mistakes are inevitable even the wisest of men. When you make errors, you learn from them. Keep in mind that making errors is a necessary part of learning and growing. Positive thinking is also an important step on the path to wisdom. Regardless of what happens in your life, keep your spirits up, have faith in yourself, and persevere. A smart guy has no fear of anything. Calmly, the problem is resolved. These, in my opinion, are the certain routes to enlightenment.</p> <p>"

According to many Greeks, history began in Athens, Sparta, Alexandria, or Constantinople, which are all cities in Greece. Those who are Muslims think that Muhammad and the Quran are important because they believe that they were the first to be made.

Nothing about our faith, culture, or civilization is disputed by us.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Human sacrifice and religious study are not the way to keep our cosmos afloat. No one knows how old the cosmos is, so assuming that human sacrifice and religious reading can save it is absurd.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>If the Egyptians had created the missile and rocket, we could have gone to the moon long ago.

After he lost, the Persian King Cyrus the Great and his troops took over his money.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The author compares this situation to today&apos;s world, where there is a lot of inequality and not enough money and resources for everyone. There hasn&apos;t been any progress toward equal rights and property for rich and poor people around the world. In order to solve all of these problems, you need to make sure everyone gets the same amount of money. He finds it hard to do this in real life. To connect the history of human rights with the history of economics, he says that there are two main steps to do:</p> <p><br></p> <p>The first was the heroic era of national welfare states after World War II.</p> <p>Second, in the 1940s, politics and economics took over the country.</p> <p><br></p> <p>But three important things were left out of Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s famous State of the Union call for a second Bill of Rights that included protections for the poor and the middle class: Provincial America&apos;s entry into the North Atlantic consensus, which promises and imagines a world without hunger. During the years after 1940, favoritism caused the world to split into two camps: one led by the United States and one led by the Soviet Union. This caused a lot of damage to human rights. Also, post-World War II decolonization did not provide the intended prosperity and human rights because these governments put &quot;national well-being&quot; above &quot;equal rights.&quot;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Samuel Moyn asks whether or not there should be another human rights movement. He then uses Herodotus&apos; example of truth and reality, which was about the need for social and economic justice to be transferred from the rich to the poor around the world. They say that everyone has the same amount of freedom and right, but this isn&apos;t true in real life. Until and unless this economic and political framework is still in place, humans won&apos;t be able to have true freedom and rights. The government must make and enforce laws that make sure that everyone has the same amount of money, and huge and radical movements are important for an egalitarian society.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the end, our shared fate is to live in the world like Croesus. In this world, the rich have a lot of fun, freedom, and everything, while the poor live in the realm of illusion, where they have floating equality and freedom.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Understanding the text</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;Answer the following questions:</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What was the first declaration of human rights that the United Nations signed into law?</b> </p> <p>There was a first human rights declaration made by the United Nations. It was about economic and social rights.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;When does Human Rights Day take place?</b> </p> <p>Human Rights Day is on December 10th every year.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What is the goal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?</b> </p> <p>This is what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is all about. It aims to make sure there is a strong foundation of liberation, equality, and peace and stability in society. Furthermore, it lists the most basic rights and values that humans deserve because they are human.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are two big stages that involve writing the history of human rights in relation to that of political economy?</b> </p> <p>New cold war era in 1948 and the heroic age of national welfare after World War II are the two big stages in writing the history of human rights and the history of politics.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the facts that have been missed in Roosevelt&rsquo;s call for a &ldquo;second Bill of Rights&rdquo;?</b> </p> <p>There are a few things that have been left out of Roosevelt&apos;s call for a &quot;second Bill of Rights.&quot;</p> <p><br></p> <p>First, it was a sign of how provincially American the United States was when it came to the North Atlantic consensus.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Second, he didn&apos;t say that he would build a safety net for everyone. Instead, he said that &quot;special privileges for the few&quot; would come to an end.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Roosevelt, on the other hand, hoped that it would spread across the world, but it was organised in the United States, not the world.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write the truth expressed in Herodotus&rsquo;s Histories.</b> </p> <p>As with local socio economic justice, new forms of judicial activity will be necessary to force the wealthy to provide more money to the poor, according to Herodotus&apos; Histories.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights important to you?</b> </p> <p>There are many reasons why I think the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is important. It makes sure that all people have the same opportunities to get what they deserve, be treated fairly, and so on.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Reference to the Context</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Does the essay give ways on how to stigmatise ( naramro dekhaunu) inequality? Explain.</b> </p> <p>In the essay &quot;Human Rights and the Age of Inequality&quot;, author &nbsp;talks about how inequality is made to seem bad. There isn&apos;t a specific way to make inequality seem bad in the essay.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The author says that if the gap between rich and poor grows this way, there will be people who don&apos;t like it. So, it is better to keep society equal and fair.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>By ensuring justice and equality, eliminating prejudice, enforcing rigorous regulations, and so on, the common people may begin a new kind of human rights movement. Inequality is seen as a negative for society as a whole since it may lead to conflict and even war.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Is another human rights movement necessary? Why?</b> </p> <p>The essayist says that another human rights movement is needed because:</p> <p><br></p> <p> i) Politics everywhere,&nbsp; ii) those in authority breach the law. ii) There is still a lot of nepotism and favouritism going on in society today, v) The law is not equal for everybody. vi) There is still a great deal of political and social domination. </p> <p>vii) Laws and rights exist only on paper; they are never enforced.</p> <p><br></p> <p>All people, regardless of wealth or social status, need equal access to justice and equal protection of their human rights.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What are the challenges in maintaining human rights in Nepal?</b> </p> <p>People in Nepal face a lot of problems when it comes to protecting their rights. The challenges are as follow:</p> <p><br></p> <p>The majority of the populace lives in poverty (particularly in rural areas)</p> <p>Disparities in educational attainment Men and women face several obstacles to equal opportunity in education.</p> <p>Children&apos;s rights are being violated.</p> <p>Abuse of authority</p> <p>Nepotism and corruption are rampant in our society.</p> <p>Many individuals lack the basic skills of literacy, such as reading and writing.</p> <p>Priority is given to a person&apos;s advantage or benefit.</p> <p>Tracking policies is difficult since there is no system for doing so.</p> <p>Inability to adhere to the letter or spirit of the law.</p> <p>"

The Earnest Young Woman kisses the Famous Actress as a sign that she has accepted the Famous Actress&apos; argument as absolute truth. She believes she has reclaimed her husband.</p> <p><br></p> <p>d. Where is the Earnest Young Woman&apos;s husband hiding himself as they are talking to him?&nbsp;</p> <p>The Earnest Young Woman&apos;s husband is hiding in the bedroom of the famous Actress. He comes towards the play&apos;s ending when the Famous Actress calls him from her bedroom.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>e. When do you feel that a Famous Actress is really good at acting?</p> <p>&nbsp;I think she&apos;s incredibly skilled at acting. Famous Actress tells Earnest Young Woman that her husband plays a game on her to pique her interest so she&apos;ll transform herself and do whatever it takes to please him. When Alfred is called out by her, I was stunned.</p> <p><br></p> <p>f.

Write down the plot of the play in a paragraph.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initially, the young lady approaches the famous actress furiously, pleading for her husband&apos;s return. Famous actress firmly denies stealing her husband. Her claim is that he was awarded a contract for a case once, and she claims to know him from that. The young lady claims that her husband has been sending flowers and writing love letters to her. She reads her husband&apos;s love letter to the actress out loud.</p> <p><br></p> <p>After hearing this, the actress blushes and continues to deny receiving any flowers or notes from him. In order to make Earnest Young Woman believe that she and her husband had a misunderstanding, she now claims that something strange happened. The Earnest Young Woman convinces Earnest Young Woman that her husband is playing with her in an attempt to make her jealous and gain her attention and love. Then, the innocent young lady realizes her mistake and begs for her apology. Alfred is called from her bedroom by the famous actress after the eager young lady exits the stage.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p>Reference to the context&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>a. Sketch the character of a Famous Actress.</p> <p>The famous actress is a cunning and clever woman. Every woman wishes she were as attractive and well-known as the Famous Actress. She seems innocent and harmless on the surface, but she is a terrible and evil person on the inside. Her deception may be apparent in the way she tells a lady that her spouse is cheating on her with someone else. To top it all off, her husband Alfred was found at her home, proving that she has immoral and unethical relations with other men.</p> <p><br></p> <p>b. Shed light on the difference between an ordinary woman and an actress.</p> <p>An ordinary lady is shown in &quot;A Matter of Husband&quot; as a straightforward and frightened woman who was easily manipulated by the actress&apos;s fabricated story. She comes tearful at the actress&apos;s home in the belief that she had discovered her husband was cheating on her with the actress but returns happy after hearing her justifications. After hearing a story about how her husband was attempting to win back her affections by doing things to make her jealous, the actress agreed. The ordinary lady trusted her and fell into her story without even asking a single question. Finally, it was revealed that her husband was in the actress&apos;s room at the end of the story. There is no arguing that the actress was cleverer than an ordinary human.</p> <p><br></p> <p>c. According to Famous Actress, men associated with theatre use the theatre actresses to make their estranged wives jealous so as to woo them back. Do you agree with her argument? Why? Why not?</p> <p><br></p> <p>No, I don&rsquo;t think the logic of the Famous Actress that the men associated with theatre use the theatre actresses to make their estranged wives jealous so as to woo them back is true. The wives of men who work in theater tend to be ordinary, gullible, and prone to being misled by a clever ruse. Alfred also could have an affair with that woman trying to win back her affections by making her jealous, but they were having a serious and immoral relation as we saw in the play. It is not the case that he uses the famous actress to provoke jealousy in his wives.</p> <p><br></p> <p>d. How does a Famous Actress make a fool of Earnest Young Woman?</p> <p><br></p> <p>An Earnest Young Wife gets fooled by the Famous Actress, who claims that she and her husband may be in a miscommunication. She convinces Earnest Young Woman that her husband has been toying with her in order to make her jealous and reclaim her love. As a result, Earnest Young sees her error and apologizes to the offended party.</p> <p><br></p> <p>e. The conversation between the two women takes place on the stage of the theatre. What role does the theatre house as a part of setting play in A Matter for Husband.</p> <p>The theatre house provided the suitable environment for the women to express their thoughts freely. If it had been opened, it would have been unreasonable to share such issues. But, the context of private rooms has played as the catalyst for their open conversation.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>f. What do you think about the ending of the play?</p> <p><br></p> <p>I think this play, &apos;A Matter of Husbands,&apos; has the most stunning, illusive and twisty ending.The play&apos;s last scene is both touching and ironic. I concluded that skilful people usually take advantage of innocent people because they are typically honest in their hearts, but innocent people constantly suffer.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the play, the actress tells a young lady that while her husband claims to love her, he doesn&apos;t care about her at all. Their assurances to her that they are not involved in any extramarital affairs are all fabricated. But, the young lady is overjoyed towards the end of the play when she thinks that she got her husband back. There&apos;s no dissatisfaction among the actors. The young woman&apos;s husband and the actress&apos;s cohabit in peace. Both the actress and the speaker are happy. They&apos;ve gotten over the obstacle that stood between them.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>In other words, I conclude from the play&apos;s ending that it was a happy ending.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p>Reference beyond the text</p> <p><br></p> <p>a. Write a paragraph describing your favourite actor/actress.</p> <p><br></p> <p>My Favorite Actor : Tom Cruise</p> <p><br></p> <p>Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors. If I had the opportunity to create the best actor from the ground up, I would make Tom Cruise. At the same time, he has a wide range of skills and is always enthusiastic about what he&apos;s doing. He has done many films like Mission: Impossible, The Mummy, Top Gun etc. His acting ranges from subtlety to over-the-topness, and he&apos;s capable of doing it all. He&apos;s a riot as a stand-up comic. In his role as an actor, he&apos;s always captivating. Moreover, he is the best action star in the industry. A movie star who works hard, he is at the top of my list of favorite actors.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>"

Adele, 27, Annette, 24, and Therese (24 yrs) are his daughters. Adele does cooking, Mr. Durand serves visitors, cleans, and does errands (including delivering and bringing things). &nbsp;Therese and Annette are useless daughters who don&rsquo;t do any work rather always behave rudely with their father.</p> <p><br></p> <p>They&apos;re all grown up now and live with him at the house with him. The father-daughter relationship is not good. They&apos;ve turned their house into a lodge in order to stay alive since they&rsquo;ve been dealing with the economic crisis for the last ten years.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The Durand family has been taking out loans from other people in order to survive. They have borrowed the items from almost everyone, including a baker, a butcher, and a grocery. There&apos;s a mountain of debt to be cleared up.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>When Pierre, their errand boy, goes to get the bread, he returns empty handed. Instead, he just has outstanding bills with him.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Durand buys candles on the anniversary of the loss of his deceased son, Rene, who was just an infant when he passed away. After all these years, he still has feelings for him.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Only Antonio, a lieutenant in the Italian army, is staying at their lodge at this time. Durand informs Antonio that they are bankrupt and have no more resources to keep him in the home (goods). Durand rejects Antonio&apos;s offer to pay in advance and extend Antonio&apos;s stay by a month. He also reveals that they went three months without visitors until an American family came to their rescue. Therese kisses Antonio, the visitor, as Durand leaves to get coffee-bread.</p> <p><br></p> <p>They are kissing when Durand enters at the doorway. Therese was caught kissing an American visitor before. In a fit of rage, he chases Antonio from his house. He also tosses the cash he was given. Therese and Annette are not delighted to see this. They&apos;d want to keep Antonio as a guest. They are disrespectful to their father. Because he didn&apos;t bring bread, they took his glass of milk as well. He&apos;s restricted to a single glass of water each day. Therese grabs matches() while he&apos;s preparing to fire his briar pipe().</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the long run, his hunger (starvation) is so severe that he even consumes the rat&apos;s bait. Fortunately, it had not been tainted by anything. In the eyes of all three girls, their father is to blame for the state of their home. It is said that if their mother were still living, the home would be in better shape. When their mother was still living, she and her husband Durand did not have a nice relationship. Their mothers&apos; side is also being taken by their daughters, who are exclusively blaming their father. When their mother was chastised for her frivolous spending, she threatened to work as a prostitute.</p> <p><br></p> <p>His girls know to turn off the stove (fire) and take careful care of their insurance paperwork (draughts) when the wind blows. They&apos;ll also get money from their insurance, he says. His daughters are now behaving themselves around him. Therese is unhappy, but he permits her to marry Antonio since he loves her and sees how unhappy she is. This makes Therese pleased and she returns him the match.</p> <p><br></p> <p>He also says that they lost their paternal fortune and utilised maternal property to raise their girls as a result of her mother&apos;s recklessness and unwise investment. As a result, they had exhausted their inheritances by the time they were done. It was her mother (Mrs. Durand) who taught children to despise their father (Durand). When she (the mother) blamed her husband for everything, she (the mother) taught her children to dislike their fathers. Because he didn&apos;t want his daughters to doubt their mother&apos;s integrity, he (Durand) remained silent throughout his whole life.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Durand encourages Adele to act as a mother figure for her sisters. He proposes that the youngest daughter Annette acquire a job as a teacher so that she may be among like-minded others and properly organize her insurance paperwork. Eventually, he downs the poison and the home catches on fire. As a result, Durand sets the home on fire and poisons himself so that his daughters might collect 5,000 francs from the fire insurance as compensation.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> <p><b>Exercise</b></p> <p><b>UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>Answer the following questions:</b></p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Where does the play take place?</b> </p> <p>Mr. Durand, a former railroad worker, widower, and boarding house owner, lives with his three daughters in the dining room of the establishment and this is the location where the play takes place.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why do the grocery, the baker and the butcher send their bills to the Durand household?</b> </p> <p>A long-term lack of payment has resulted in bills from the store, bakery, and butcher being sent to Durand&apos;s home. To avoid further delays and unpaid invoices, they are unable to provide more services.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does Monsieur Duran spend money on candles when he doesn&rsquo;t have money to buy even bread?</b> </p> <p>For the one-year anniversary of the loss of his beloved baby son Ren&eacute;, Monsieur Durand purchases candles rather than meals. Durand misses the departed, yet he still cares about and loves him. And to combat the lacking life for his daughters, Durand intends to intentionally set fire to his house and then claim the insurance proceeds.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why did Monsieur Duran sell his life insurance?</b> </p> <p>Monsieur wanted to clear the debt by selling his life insurance policy. That&rsquo;s why he sold his life insurance.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why has Monsieur Duran paid fire insurance?</b> </p> <p>Monsieur Durand has signed up a new fire insurance policy so that he may file a claim for reimbursement in the event of a fire. He plans to burn his home down to receive the money offered to him as compensation for the loss so that he may support his children.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How did Monsieur Duran and Mrs. Duran run out of their inheritances from both sides?</b> </p> <p>Inheritances from both sides of the Durand family were drained by Mrs. Durand&apos;s negligence and reckless investment. In raising their girls, they relied on both their paternal and maternal ancestry, which they both lost.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does Monsieur Durand tell a lie about his birthplace?</b> </p> <p>Monsieur Durand tells a lie about his birthplace because of two separate motives.</p> <p><br></p> <p>One reason was that, from the side of Switzerland, he fought against his own nation France. He speaks an untruth to try to cover up his embarrassment.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Another was, by fabricating his own story, he hopes to maintain the image of himself and his wife.</p> <p><br></p> <p>He was attracted to a lady much younger than he was. That woman was the one he wanted to marry. As a result, he packed up his items and relocated to Switzerland from his hometown.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What business is Monsieur Durand running to make a living?</b> </p> <p>For income, Monsieur Durand runs a boarding house. In order to supplement his income, he has turned his residence into a lodge.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What plan does Monsieur Durand have to help his daughters with money?</b> </p> <p>Monsieur Durand intends to take his own life and burn down his home. He expects to be compensated by his fire insurance policy and use the money to assist his children. To save his three children, he is willing to give his life as protection money.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does Monsieur Durand die?</b> </p> <p>Monsieur Durand dies by consuming poison. He did so to assist his daughters with the amount of money they will be reimbursed from their insurance policy.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>REFERENCE TO THE CONTEXT</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Sketch the character of Monsieur Durand.</b> </p> <p>The play&apos;s central character is Monsieur Durand. In addition to being a lodge owner, he is also a retired railroad worker. He is a bankrupt man with three young daughters. The lodge is their home.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Durand and his daughters have a tense relationship. We see him as a loving, caring, and protective father in this play. He and his three daughters are living in misery as a result of his insolvency.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Most of the time, we see his daughters dislike and blame him for everything. As long as he&apos;s thinking about his two daughters, he&apos;ll never give up. He puts his own life on the line to protect his estranged daughters, who despise him.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>He is a man of great patience who remained silent for the rest of his life, though the real culprit of such circumstances was caused by his late wife. He is also a devoted husband and a good father. Though he is compelled to live in Switzerland, he is a patriotic Frenchman who adores his homeland. Because of his concern for his three daughters&apos; safety, he is a tragic hero who sacrifices his own happiness in order to protect theirs.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How do we know that the Durand family has reached a dead end?</b> </p> <p>We know this family has come to a dead end because of their financial crisis. For years, the Durands have survived on loans from friends and relatives. The Durand family has a load of debts to pay to various creditors. Due to financial constraints, they have turned their house into an inn.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Durand&apos;s condition is the worst in the family. His daughters hate him and blame him for everything. They even cut off bread for a cup of coffee. Durand eats the rat&apos;s food because of hunger. Yet, we find him tolerable.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>At last, Durand intends to kill himself and set fire to his lodge to rescue his daughter.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;&lsquo;The mother, though already dead, seems to have had a great influence on the daughters, especially Theresa.&rsquo; Do you agree?</b> </p> <p>Yes, I think this is correct. In this play, we see that the mother has had a significant impact on her daughters, particularly Theresa.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Mother instilled a deep hatred for their father Durand in them while she was still alive. She forced them to follow her orders. She frequently blamed her husband and was able to turn the children against him. All three daughters dislike their father because of their mother&apos;s teachings. When they look back, they blame their father for everything that went wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>To prevent his daughters from questioning the goodness of their mother, Mr. Durand remained silent after her death. He is a man of great patience who remained silent for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Her mother has had the greatest effect on Theresa. She is the one of the three sisters that has the most hatred against their father. Most of the time, she shows a rude attitude. When her father was about to inhale tobacco with a briar pipe, she snatched the matches from his hand. In the same way, she takes his glass of milk. She appears to have a very bad attitude toward her father.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Discuss the relationship between Monsieur Duran and his wife.</b> </p> <p>Monsieur Durand and his wife had a strained relationship. However, Mrs. Durand blamed Mr. Durand even though she herself had ruined the family during her lifetime. It was ruined by her carelessness and foolish decisions.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>She used to buy lottery tickets with money from the family. She threatened to become a prostitute for money after being mistreated by her husband. She instilled in all of her daughters a hatred for their father and instilled in them all kinds of negativity. She had mastered the art of diverting her girls&apos; attention and turning them against their father.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;&lsquo;Money determines the relationship between characters in this play.&rsquo; Elaborate this statement with examples from the play.</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p>Due to the economic crisis, Mr. Durund is unable to pay for his daughters&apos; basic necessities. Due to the economic downturn, they have decided to transform their home into a lodge. Mr. Durand and Mrs. Durand&apos;s relationship deteriorated as well due to the huge loss of their property. The girls hate their father since he is unable to maintain the family financially.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>The connection between the characters is determined by money in this case. Most of the time, Mr. Durand&apos;s three daughters despise and blame him. They display their disrespectful behaviour in front of him. Because the father is unable to bring bread, the girls do not even offer a drink of milk. They grabbed his glass of milk and pulled it away from him. When he goes to smoke, they take the matches from him. When their father promises, &quot;I&apos;ll bring you money,&quot; they demonstrate their generosity. They even give him a passionate kiss. They even express regret for their disrespectful behaviour.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Monsieur Durand killed himself so that his daughters would get 5000 francs as compensation from the insurance company. What does his plan tell us about him?</b> </p> <p>Mr. Durund has lived in abject poverty all of his life. As a result of the economic downturn, his daughters have frequently placed the blame on him for their problems. He has been widely regarded as a bad parent because of his inability to raise his children properly.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>We know that he is a loving and caring father because of his plans for his daughters&apos; well-being and their future. He is the father who gives up his life for the sake of his three young daughters&apos; bright futures.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Discuss Facing Death as a modern tragedy.</b> </p> <p>&quot;Modern tragedies&quot; are plays about tragic events with an unhappy ending, particularly one involving the downfall of the protagonist. Furthermore, modern tragedy deals with the modern individual&apos;s problems, such as dysfunctional family relationships, socio-cultural issues, loneliness, and so on. Modern plays have a strong emphasis on realism and naturalism.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The tragic death of the main character, Mr. Durand, marks the play&apos;s status as a modern tragedy. The characters become victims of their socio-cultural environment, fate, economic class, gender, and the external environment, among other factors.</p> <p><br></p> <p>This drama has all of the markers of modern tragedy. At the heart of this drama is the portrayal of a contemporary guy who is in the middle of a life-altering crisis. Because of the downturn in the economy, he and his three daughters have had to endure a great deal of suffering.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the play, things about relationships and finances are also greatly discussed. Mr. Durand and other contemporary men like him have suffered immensely because of the economic downturn. Mr. Durand, the play&apos;s central character, dies tragically at the play&apos;s conclusion. In order to protect his three little girls, he commits himself and burns down his home so that he could gain reimbursement from the fire insurance. In this drama, both realism and naturalism are examined.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Reference beyond the text</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write a few paragraphs describing the role of the father in the family.</b> </p> <p>Fathers have an important role in Nepalese households because of the country&apos;s patriarchal traditions and beliefs. Fathers are traditionally seen as the family&apos;s social and political protector in Nepalese households.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In a Nepali family, the father has the most important role, and he is the one who sets the standard for the rest of the family&apos;s activities. The presence of the father provides a feeling of stability for the whole family. He is the earner who is responsible for the well-being of his family. The family&apos;s primary caregiver is the father, who assumes responsibility for the well-being of his loved ones.</p> <p><br></p> <p>As a parent, the role of a father is to instruct and lead his children on the path of righteousness. Developing a child&apos;s self-esteem is a father&apos;s responsibility. He is the one who passes on to his offspring the values of the family&apos;s culture, traditions, and customs. Father establishes the guidelines for the good future of the children. The emotional well-being of children is greatly influenced by the influence of their fathers. Father supports his children&apos;s academic endeavours. Fathers set the standard for interactions with others. In order to provide for his family, the father has to put up with a lot of difficulties. Physical and emotional stability are provided by fathers to their children.</p> <p>"

      "story": " <p><b>The Bull&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Summary&nbsp;</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>One-act play &quot;The Bull&quot; has been written by Nepali poet and playwright Bhimnidhi Tiwari, who is widely regarded as one of the country&apos;s greatest writers. A satire of the feudal structure in the society at the time of the play (18th century). As a result of the death of King Rana Bahadur Shah&apos;s bull, Male, a bull doctor and two cowherds named Jitman and Gore are in a state of fear.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In 1854 B.S., the drama was staged in the month of Ashwin. Gore and Jitman, two cowherds, arrive to Laxminarayan&apos;s residence at the opening of the play in a state of terror. They&apos;ve come to deliver the news of King Ranabahadur Shah&apos;s bull&apos;s death. Laxminarayan shivers as they tell their tale. They&apos;re all starting to become nervous about what the king may do to them. The monarch has the power to sentence them to death. Fear of being punished by having his hair shaved drives Laxminarayan crazy. As a penalty for speaking too loudly in front of the monarch, Laxminarayan had his lips burned once. That side of Laxminarayan&apos;s moustache never grows again.</p> <p><br></p> <p>They both say that the bull died because it didn&apos;t eat enough grass and couldn&apos;t eat fine rice and split-gram soup. When the bull has died, Laxminarayan instructs the cowherds to keep it quiet. They will suffer a severe punishment if they tell the king about the death of the bull.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Laxminarayan heads to the Basantpur palace to notify the king of the bull&apos;s deteriorating condition. Laxminarayan respectfully notifies the king that the bull is unwell, bowing his head in humility. He doesn&apos;t notify the king immediately that the bull has died.</p> <p><br></p> <p>He tells the king about the condition of the sick bull. He claims that the bull sir doesn&apos;t get up in the morning and eat his meal. He does not talk or move at all. He keeps his gaze fixed on the ground, his face expressionless. Laxminarayan begins complimenting the bull&apos;s beauty, gait, and bravery. He recommends taking the bull to the hill to fight climate change and repair its health.</p> <p><br></p> <p>When the king heard Laxminarayan&apos;s statements, he decided to go to Thulo Gauchara with a chariot caravan to inspect the bull&apos;s condition.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Cowherds Jitman and Gore, on the other hand, are awaiting the king&apos;s decision in the farm house with anxiously. They&apos;ve considered fleeing for their lives, but they&apos;re afraid they&apos;ll be arrested once again and put to death. The king is getting closer. At Thulo Gauchar, Laxminarayan goes ahead of the caravan and instructs the cowherds to massage the bull&apos;s rear feet and wave a fan at him. They do as such. He even tells the king that they&apos;ve been taking care of the bull since midnight.</p> <p><br></p> <p>On the other hand, the bull is truly dead on the mattress. There isn&apos;t even a gasp. It isn&apos;t doing any of those things, either. Its ears and tail have both fallen. However, for reasons of fear, neither the cowherds nor Laxminarayan can pronounce it dead. The bull, according to King Ranabahadur Shah, has died.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Upon hearing the king&apos;s statement, Jitman breaks down in tears and tells that he has been orphaned because the bull&apos;s death left him all alone. The King gives him a 400 rupee tip and orders him to keep silent.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Gore bursts into tears as well. He claims that the bull is more important to him than his mother, father, wife, and kids. He says he&apos;ll either go with the bull or hang himself. Upon hearing this, the monarch gives him a gratuity of 500 rupees.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>For the first time, Laxminarayan begins to cry and pretends to be in pain. Angry with him, the King assigns the task of burying and honouring the dead bull to him, along with other duties. Finally, Gore and Jitman express their joy at still being alive.</p> <p><br></p> <p>One can clearly see the feudal system of that time in this drama, &quot;The Bull,&quot; which exposes the oppression and dehumanisation of the common man. Animals owned by feudal lords were more deserving of respect than those of the common people. Dehumanization of common people by feudal lords; slavery of Lords/Kings; and subjugation/dominance of women are all topics that come up in this play.</p> <p><br></p> <p><b>UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why have Gore and Jitman come to see Laxminarayan?</b> </p> <p>King Ranabahadur Shah&apos;s bull (Male) has died, and the cowherds Gore and Jitman have come to tell Laxminarayan about it.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What, according to cowherds, is the reason behind the death of Male?</b> </p> <p>Cowherds believed that Male died because he was starving and unable to digest fine rice and split gram, the basic foods.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does Ranabahadur want to see the bull himself?</b> </p> <p>Ranabahadur wants to meet the bull himself because he wants to verify the bull&apos;s health and doesn&apos;t want the bull to be brought to the hill if it is healed or treated at Thulo Gauchar, Kathmandu.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why does Laxminarayan run ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gaucharan?</b> </p> <p>Ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gaucharan, Laxminarayan rushes to give the cowherds instructions to massage the bull&apos;s rear feet and wave fans at it in order to impress King Ranabahadur Shah. He would get furious and punish them otherwise. He wants to show the king how much they care about the bull.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Why do Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that Male is dead?</b> </p> <p>To demonstrate their supposed affection and concern for the bull, Gore and Jitman weep as the king announces the Male dead. Immediately, they both begin pleading with the king for his forgiveness. They hope to escape the anger of the king by their efforts. He could punish them and punish them for his bull&apos;s death otherwise.</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How do we learn that the bull is dead?</b> </p> <p>Cowherds and the king tell us that the bull has died, based on their words. He does not breathe, his tail has loosened, ears have fallen backward, and he doesn&apos;t even eat. &quot;The bull does not breathe, his tail is loose, ears have fallen backward and it doesn&apos;t feed either.&quot;</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does the play make a satire on the feudal system?</b> </p> <p>The drama depicts the dehumanisation and oppression of feudal rulers on their workers. Common people live in terror because the lord&apos;s animal is treated better than they. The feudal system has suppressed, dominated, and dehumanised them. We have seen the cowherds who survive on the Lord&apos;s kindness and grace. This drama depicted the feudal society and its abuse of common people.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>REFERENCE TO THE CONTEXT&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Discuss the late eighteenth-century Nepali society as portrayed in terms of the relation between the king and his subjects as portrayed in the play.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>The monarchy system was in place in Nepal in the 1800s. The Shah Dynasty governed Nepal at the time. This nation has a lot of set rules. People were deprived of their freedom. The king and his soldiers had to be obeyed at all costs.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The rulers and lords in &quot;The Bull&apos;&apos; represented a cruel society. People&apos;s circumstances weren&apos;t really good. Politics was little understood by the citizenry. People were punished for not performing swosthi for the kings and lords (bow down to them). They would be punished if they revolted against their rulers. Their rulers abused them. People had no fundamental rights. Females were obliged to live under the dominance of men. Males used to have many wives. The monarchs or lords had total influence over the commoners&apos; lives.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;What does the relation between Laxminarayan and his wives tell us about the society of that time? To what extent has the Nepali society changed since then?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Ranabahadur Shah&apos;s bull doctor and bichari (legal officer) Laxminarayan is a forty-year-old guy. Throughout his life, he has been married to seven women. Even with seven women in the house, he still doesn&apos;t look happy. He&apos;s still thinking about getting married to someone else.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>At home, he refers to his seven wives as &quot;flat-nosed,&quot; &quot;pretty,&quot; &quot;butterfly,&quot; &quot;swallow,&quot; &quot;ugly face,&quot; and other insulting terms. Using various nicknames for each of his wives, he demonstrates patriarchal dominance as well as the plight of women in the culture at the time.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>It shows a society where men were seen as superior creatures and women as inferior, gender roles were rigidly enforced. The married women were enslaved to their husbands for the rest of their lives. Illiteracy, child marriage, poverty, feudalism, and a general lack of education were the root causes of all of these problems. The practice of marrying many women was prevalent at the time. They were forced to rely on others and spent much of their time inside their homes.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Since then, Nepali society has seen significant transformations. The current state of affairs for Nepali women is significantly superior than expectations. Nepali women&apos;s awareness and literacy have risen exponentially. Women have occupied most of the top posts in Nepal. They earn the same as males. The Nepalese constitution ensures equal opportunity for men and women and punishes individuals who disrespect women. Society is not male-dominated. They no longer have to depend on men to survive.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Shed light on the practice of chakari as portrayed in the play. Have you noticed this practice in your society?</b> </p> <p>The notion of chakari appears often in &quot;The Bull.&quot; Laxminarayn Dahal and two cowherds Gore and Jitman perform a lot of the king Ranabahadur Shah&apos;s chakari. They appear afraid of the king. Fear of the king&apos;s anger makes them polite.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Laxminarayan is a character who masters chakari. He has even been punished by the king for speaking loudly in front of the king. Both cowherds tell Laxminarayan after the bull dies. They all dread the king. The dead bull and both cowherds sleep on the cowshed. They act quite cautious around the bull. They massage the bull&apos;s feet and fan him to please the king. In front of the king, they call the bull &quot;The Bull Sir.&quot; When the king proclaims the bull dead, both cowherds sob deeply. So the play is chakari-heavy.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Yes, I&apos;ve seen this a lot in my culture. Everyone does chakari. But chakari is done in a different manner than the society of the time. People practice chakari of politicians a lot nowadays in Nepal for money, status, and wealth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;How does Laxminarayan outsmart Ranabahadur?&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Laxminarayan rushes to the king&apos;s palace as soon as he learns of the bull&apos;s death. He excels at kingly flattery (chakari). He doesn&apos;t notify the king about the bull&apos;s death since the king could be enraged. He informs the king about the bull&apos;s illness instead of the actuality. He tells the cowherds to massage and fan the bull to please the king. The king believes the bull died despite excellent care and treatment. Because of Laxminarayan&apos;s techniques, the king doesn&apos;t question them, and they avoid punishment.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Sketch the character of Laxminarayan.</b> </p> <p>This one-act play&apos;s central character is Laxminarayan Dahal. He is a forty-year-old king Rana Bahadur Shah&apos;s bull doctor and a legal official. He has had seven wives. He has a total of seven spouses, yet he seems to be unhappy with all of them. He plans to wed the eighth of these women.</p> <p><br></p> <p>When he learns of the death of the king&apos;s bull, he employs his intellect to great effect, saving not only his own but also the lives of the cowherds. He is well-versed in the king&apos;s chakari (bullying).&nbsp;</p> <p>They were spared the anger of the king thanks to his skillful tactics. To summarize, Laxminarayan has outwitted the king with his clever tactics and flattery.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><b>REFERENCE BEYOND THE TEXT&nbsp;</b></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;Write an essay in about 300 words on &ldquo;The Nepali Society: Past, Present and Future&rdquo;.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p><b>The Nepali Society: Past, Present and Future</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>We use the term &quot;society&quot; to refer to a long-standing collection of people who share cultural features such as language, clothing, social standards, and creative forms. However, cultural practises are frequently blended and people from various cultures might be observed practising the customs of each other.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Nepali society has undergone significant transformations throughout the years. &nbsp;Feudalism was pervasive throughout history. Women, as well as the general populace, had a difficult time in the past. They had to rely on kings or rulers to make a life. In terms of women&apos;s life during the period, things were quite difficult for them. For the majority of peasants, life was a struggle. It was so typical for children to marry one other. Society was extremely strict.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The destiny of others was formerly decided by feudalists or lords in most countries. People&apos;s lives were hampered by a shortage of resources. They had no understanding of the rights and possibilities that each person has in their own life. Because of patriarchal customs and ideals, women were confined to their own homes. At that time, patriarchal ideals and customs were at their zenith. Under the feudalists, the lives of the common people were dismal.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Nepalese societies now seem to be quite different from Nepalese communities of the past. The situation of Nepali women is much better than imagined at this point in time. People now have a wide range of liberties that cover a wide range of issues. Nepal&apos;s constitution has given women significant privileges throughout the years. Nepal is experiencing a wide range of developments in several industries. Nepali society has seen significant transformations in areas such as electricity, clean drinking water, improved roads and transportation, and improved educational opportunities. Nepalese society is now on the path to progress.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The political component of Nepali society has become a major part of this time which has the power to change the society. &nbsp;We need to put politics aside and focus on the bright future of the Nepali people and the country as a whole. Nepal&apos;s future will be bright, I believe, provided we, as Nepalese people, pick the best candidates for our country&apos;s advancement.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> <b>&nbsp;In his &ldquo;Satire 9&rdquo;, Nicolas Boileau-Despr&eacute;aux says:</b> </p> <p><br></p> <p><b><i>But satire, ever moral, ever new</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Delights the reader and instructs him, too.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>She, if good sense, refine her sterling page,</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Oft shakes some rooted folly of the age.</i></b></p> <p><br></p> <p><b>Do you agree with the poet? Discuss the lines with reference to Bhimnidhi Tiwari&rsquo;s play &ldquo;The Bull&rdquo;.</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>A well-crafted piece of satire may both amuse and educate its audience, according to Nicolas&apos;s message in the preceding verse. To some extent, the errors and missteps of an era may be shattered if the satire is written with a good purpose in mind.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In that sense, I absolutely agree with the poet. Positive satire may help to ameliorate society&apos;s many bad aspects.</p> <p><br></p> <p>This play &quot;The Bull&quot; by Bhimnidhi Tiwari is a cutting satire on the feudal system that dehumanizes humans to the point that their life is dependent on respectful behaviour towards four-footed animals like bulls. Using humor, Tiwari provides his readers with a wide range of information on the society of the period, both good and bad.</p> <p><br><br></p> "
